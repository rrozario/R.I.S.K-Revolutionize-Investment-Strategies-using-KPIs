"The number of coronavirus infections in South Dakota has increased three-fold in a week to more than 1,000 but the state's Republican GovernorKristi Noem is still refusing to order a lockdown. Infections in the Midwest state have trebled in just one week and the state now has one of the country's largest virus hotspots following an outbreak at a meat plant. At the start of the month there were only 129 infections in the state but, as of Wednesday, 1,168 cases have now been reported. The state has recorded six deaths amid the pandemic - the lowest of any state apart from Wyoming, which recorded its first death this week. South Dakota saw its infection numbers spike following an outbreak at a Chinese-owned pork processing plant in Sioux Falls where about 500 employees tested positive for coronavirus. An estimated 120 people, who are family members of the employees, have also now tested positive. The combination of the figures means the outbreak atSmithfield Foods, which was forced to shut down this week, is the single largest cluster of coronavirus cases in the country. Despite the surge in cases, Gov Noem - as recently as Wednesday - was standing firm on her decision not to issue a stay-at-home order for the state. She has argued that it was up to individuals - and not governments - to decide if they should go to work, worship or stay at home. South Dakota is among only five states in the country - all of which have Republican governors - that currently do not have lockdown orders in place. Defending her decision earlier this month, Gov Noem suggested the lockdowns imposed on 95 percent of the country was 'herd mentality, not leadership'. 'South Dakota is not New York City,' she said. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Gov Noem accused the media of conflating her decision not to issue a lockdown with the outbreak at the food plant. 'We trusted South Dakotans to exercise personal responsibility to keep themselves and their loved-ones healthy. They've stepped up to the challenge,' she tweeted. 'Let's be perfectly clear: a shelter-in-place order would NOT have prevented Smithfield from happening. They are a critical infrastructure business. They are part of the nation's food supply chain and contribute to South Dakota's role feeding the country and the world.' Addressing the outbreak in a Fox News interview on Monday, GovNoem said:'It certainly is a tense situation there but we've got a lot of people focused on helping those individuals get better. 'Overall the state is doing very, very well. This hot spot is one area that we are addressing.' Smithfield Foods, which is headquartered in Virginia, is owned by China's WH Group Ltd. The company announced that in addition to closing itsSioux Falls plant, it was also shutting plants in Wisconsin and Missouri. Employees, local officials and industry sources told Reuters late last year that workers box up pig carcasses to ship to China instead of providing meat to Americans. It comes after theSouth Dakota State Medical Association wrote a letter to Gov Noem on April 3 urging her to issue a quarantine order for residents. 'A stay-at-home order would give our health professionals the necessary time and resources to manage this pandemic,' the group said. 'We may soon be facing the challenges and hardships being seen in New York and other cities if a shelter in place order is not issued immediately.' Sioux Falls Mayor Paul Ten Haken, who is also a Republican, issued an ordinance this week that requires residents in the city to stay at home after Gov Noem refused his request to issue a statewide one. His ordinance allows residents to still travel for work, as well as out for groceries and essential items.It urges people to social distance if they are outside. In an interview with CBS This Morning on Wednesday, the mayor said the number of cases were 'staggering'. 'The growth that we've seen in our COVID cases, really in the last week, has been a bit staggering,' TenHaken said. 'We're doubling and we've been doubling every four days for the last 18 days.' In reference to Gov Noem refusing to issue a lockdown, the mayor went on to say that he would rather be 'chastised for being over-cautious' than for not doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

"The United States death toll from the coronavirus is nearing 30,000 after an additional 1,500 Americans died in one day - down from the record 2,500 in the previous 24 hours. The increase in deaths on Wednesday brought the total death toll in the United States to just over 27,600. The death toll has doubled in the past week. More than 630,000 people have now been infected with the coronavirus in the US after the number of cases increased on Wednesday by 18,000. A University of Washington model, often cited by the White House, this week predicted the total US deaths in the pandemic could reach about 68,800 by early August. That model suggests the United States has not even reached the halfway point in possible fatalities. Deaths in hard-hit New York state are now at10,842 after increasing by 752 in a day. New York state, which remains the epicenter of the US outbreak, has more than 203,000 confirmed cases. New Jersey follows with68,824 infections and2,805 deaths. Massachusetts has overtaken Michigan to become the state with the third highest number of infections with nearly 27,000 cases and 844 deaths. Michigan has just over 25,000 confirmed infections and 1,602 deaths. Meanwhile, New York Cityannounced 3,778 additional 'probable' deaths attributed to coronavirus thatwere never confirmed because no test was administered. The probably deaths, announced on Tuesday, occurred between March 11 and April 13, and when combined with confirmed deaths take the city's coronavirus death toll higher than 10,000. Due to a shortage of test kits, particularly in the early days of the outbreak, not everyone hospitalized in critical condition or found dead at home was able to be tested for the virus. Postmortem tests were often not conducted in order to conserve test resources. City officials said that the newly announced deaths were ruled probable based on the known symptoms and health histories of the patients who died. Roughly 60 percent of the probable deaths occurred in hospitals, versus 90 percent for confirmed cases, according to city data. Eighteen percent of the probable deaths occurred in nursing homes, and 22 percent occurred in private residences, officials said. After saying earlier this week that New York had passed the worst of the crisis, Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday ordered his state's 19 million residents to wear masks or substitutes when in any public situation that may not allow them to be at least six feet away from others. New Yorkers will have three days to comply with the order, aimed at ensuring the mask wearer does not infect others. Cuomo said 752 people died in his state in the past day - down slightly from the previous day but still high, although hospitalizations declined in a sign the crisis was easing. The tolls come as lawmakers and health officials work on deciding when the US should reopen again. Current social distancing measures in the United States are due to expire on April 30 but health experts are urging for continued social distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus. Topinfectious disease Dr Anthony Fauci on Tuesdaystopped short of naming a single state that he believes can reopen before May 1 like President Trump has suggested. His refusal to name a state came just hours after he was absent from the most recent White House coronavirus press briefing after calling Trump's lengthy Q&A sessions 'draining'. In an NBC interview on Tuesday night, Dr Fauci - the top infectious disease expert in the US - was asked what states, if any, could reopen after Trump flouted that some could reopen even before his federal guidelines expire. 'I'm certain... that he's talking about some of the states that have low levels, low density of population and a lot of geographic land,' Fauci said without naming possible locations. 'I haven't gone state by state through them. There is going to be a great deal of variability there. It's not going to be one size fits all.' Dr Fauci went on to say that before states reopen, it was imperative that each area was equipped to be able to quickly identify, isolate and treat any new cases to avoid another surge. 'Minimum thing is you have got to be able to identify, isolate, get out of circulation and do adequate and appropriate contract tracing as new cases arrive,' he said. 'The real proof of success if how quickly you identify them... and you do contact tracing so you don't have the beginning of a peak.' Dr Fauci stopped short of saying whether he believed the worst of the pandemic was over. Earlier on Tuesday, Dr Fauci echoed his comments saying that a May 1 target date for reopening the economy was 'a bit overly optimistic' due to a lack of critical testing and tracing procedures. He was noticeably absent from Tuesday night's briefing during which Trump appeared to back off his previous claim of absolute authority to decide when the time was right to act to reopen states. Abattle erupted between Trump and state governors on Tuesday over who has the power to lift restrictions aimed at curbing the coronavirus pandemic. Hours after suggesting that the bipartisan concerns of governors about his assertion of power would amount to an insurrection, Trump abruptly reversed course Tuesday, saying he would leave it to governors to determine the right time and manner to revive activity in their states. He said he would be speaking with governors, probably on Thursday, to discuss his plans.'The governors are responsible,' Trump said. 'They have to take charge.' Still, he insisted: 'The governors will be very, very respectful of the presidency.' Democratic and Republican governors had sounded the alarm after Trump asserted Monday that he and he alone would determine when and how to reopen the economy, despite clear constitutional limitations on federal powers. Trump said Tuesday he would be authorizing governors 'of each individual state to implement a reopening - and a very powerful reopening - plan of their state at a time and in a matter as most appropriate.'  He added that he would support moves by states that haven't been hit hard by the outbreak to ease restrictions even before federal guidelines on social distancing expire April 30. Trump said the country would open up 'in beautiful little pieces,' adding that some states with low rates of infection 'have fewer people and they have lots of room.' It's unclear if any states are actively considering reopening their economies before May 1. Trump had earlier lashed outat the Democratic state governors suggesting they were 'mutineers' after New York's Andrew Cuomo said he would refuse any order by the president to reopen the economy too soon. 'If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn't do it,' Cuomo told CNN early in the day, referring to Trump. At a news conference later, Cuomo said Trump was 'clearly spoiling for a fight on this issue' and that he did not want a partisan battle, but added, 'We don't have a king in this country, we have a Constitution and we elect the president.' Cuomo, a Democrat whose state has been the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, and governors of six other northeastern states and one Republican, have announced plans to formulate a regional plan to gradually lift restrictions. On the West Coast, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington state announced a similar regional approach."
"Furious demonstrators gathered Wednesday at Michigan's state Capitol, creating a massive traffic jam filled with honking cars and flag-waving protesters in defiance of the state's stringent statewide stay-at-home orders - demanding that they are lifted. The raucous gathering dubbed #OperationGridlock was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition (MCC) in Lansing in protest at Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer’s lockdown rules that will last through April 30. Last Thursday she signed a new executive order tightening constraints by closing home-improvement stores, restricting interstate travel, and barring constituents from fleeing the heavily afflicted parts of the state to their cabins in rural Michigan. Video and photos from the protest show residents wrapped in winter coats and hats carrying signs that say 'Stop the Fear', 'End the Lockdown' and 'Heil Whitmer', comparing the governor to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Protesters, some bearing guns, waved American flags from the windows of the State Capitol building while others waved MAGA flags and wore matching red hats bearing the Trump slogan. Those who were there complained that they could not get to the hairdresser or stock up on lawn fertilizer. The demonstrators notably ignored social distancing measures and most were seen without protective masks or gloves, even though Michigan has the fourth-great outbreak of coronavirus in the country with over 28,000 infections and nearly 2,000 deaths. Three lanes of traffic were filled with lines of cars blaring their horns outside of the state building on Capitol Avenue Wednesday afternoon, with locals declaring they’re ready to get back to work and get back to their regular lives. Traffic was backed up for more than a mile in multiple directions in the protest. Signed an executive order extending Michigan’s stay-at-home order through April and imposed new rules Some locals were seen shouting and jumping on top of their cars, calling for the Governor to be removed and lockdown restrictions lifted. Others were heard chanting 'recall Whitmer', 'USA', and 'lock her up', outside the Capitol building. Neither the Michigan State Police or the Lansing Police Department had reported any arrests by 2pm local time. Last week Whitmer issued a new executive order. The new policy closed big-box stores that sell gardening and home-improvement goods, limited the use of motorboats, closed public golf courses, restricted interstate travel, and banned constituents from fleeing the areas of the state with concentrated COVID-19 cases to their second homes in more rural areas in Michigan. She also banned any gatherings of people who are not a part of a single household. The activists complained that the rules violated their civil liberties and freedoms, expressed anger over which businesses were allowed to remain open, and frustration over the cancellation of Easter and Passover services. They believe people are smart enough to make their own decisions regarding the coronavirus epidemic. 'I’m a state representative from the 102nd district and I’m here to support my people. I have a lot of constituents down here right now,' State Rep. Michele Hoitenga said in an interview with a local station. 'They want to get back to work. They can’t access the website to get benefits, then they want to get back to work. We’re recommending we adapt to federal guidelines to do it safely,' she explained. Most protesters expressed their desire to get back to work as unemployment in the country has skyrocketed by over 16million over the past three weeks. 'I'd rather die from the coronavirus than see a generational company be gone,'Justin Heyboer of Alto, Michigan, said to USA Today. His family has owned Wildwood Family Farms for four generations, which is suffering a major financial blow in light of the coronavirus crisis and lockdown. 'It’s time for our state to be opened up. I’m tired of not being able to buy the things we need, go to the hair dressers, get our hair done,' one woman said to Fox News, showing her graying roots. 'Can’t buy paint, can’t buy lawn fertilizer or grass seed, come on, all statewide?' another local added. 'All of these people still have to go home to the sober reality that they don't have income coming in. It's heartbreaking,'Meshawn Maddock, a board member of the Michigan Conservative Coalition, said. Whitmer's executive order was met with immediate backlash let by Republican state legislators who found her rules draconian and excessive. On Tuesday a group of four Michigan residents filed a lawsuit against her saying her order infringes upon First and Fourth Amendment rights. President Donald Trump said in March he had a ‘big problem’ with Whitmer referring to her as 'that young, a woman governor'. 'I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen 'Half' Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn't have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA,' he tweeted. 'Governor Whitmer believes that everyone has a right to protest and speak up,' Whitmer's deputy press secretary said of the Wednesday protests in a statement, according to Business Insider. 'She knows that a lot of people are angry and frustrated, and will always defend everyone's rights to free speech – the Governor asks those who choose to protest these orders to do so in a manner that doesn't put their health or the health of our first responders at risk.' The governor spoke out about the backlash she’s received from the MCC in a news conference earlier this week, in which she pointed out that the group is funded in large part by the family of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and is very active in Michigan conservative politics. 'This group is funded in large part by the DeVos family,' she said Monday, according to local station WWJ. 'And I think it's really inappropriate for a sitting member of the United States president's Cabinet to [be] waging political attacks on any governor.' 'I think that they should disavow it, and I encourage people to stay home and be safe,' she said. "
"In early April, the CDC recommended that all Americans cover their faces when they venture out in public, either with store-bought masks or homemade coverings fashioned from cloth. Pointing to new studies, the organizationsaid that people who are asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic can still transmit the virus, and masks 'can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.' As the month progresses, more and more cities and states are implementing new guidelines, making it mandatory for people to cover their mouths and noses while in grocery stores, banks, public transit, and other public areas. In his daily press briefing on Wednesday, New York Governor Cuomoissued an executive order that all New Yorkers must wear masks or face coverings in public whenever staying six feet apart isn't possible. A week ago,Governor Murphy of New Jersey signed his own executiveorder, order ing all customers and employees in grocery stores to wear face masks. Similar rules have been rolled out across California, in Maryland and Illinois, and in other cities and counties across the country. With masks becoming a way of life for so many around the US, the different options on the market can see overwhelming. Here, DailyMail.com breaks downwhat you need to know about the types available and their relative effectiveness: N95 respirators The N95 face mask is backed by the World Health Organization as suitable for medical use. They're also regulated by the CDC,OSHA, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). But what does the N95 mean? The 'N' stands for 'Not resistant to oil,' because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids. The '95' means it filters out 95 per cent of airborne particles. Because these masks offer so much protection, they're used by doctors and nurses in hospitals who are caring for sick patients. But due to shortages, the CDC does not recommend these for the general public, calling them 'critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for health care workers and other medical first responders.' With even medical professionals struggling to get their hands on enough N95 masks — and being forced to re-wear them, which can diminish their efficacy — few members of the American public will have these for themselves. They usually sell for about $1 each, with stores like Home Depot selling packs of ten for$10.69 and packs of 20 for$14.99. But N95 masks are sold out from nearly all stores and websites, with availability limited to international sellers, mostly in China. Those are being sold at marked-up prices, like $49.99 for just two on Amazon. Disposable surgical masks The best known type of medical face mask, known as a surgical mask, is proving to be the most popular during the pandemic. Doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers are now instructed to wear these types of masks as a minimum at all times when working near confirmed or suspected coronavirus patients. They are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care, or for those who are not inserting or removing breathing equipment. Although they don't have built-in air filters, the masks can stop droplets of liquid, which are how the majority of the COVID-19 viruses are spread. These masks are disposable andare not intended to be used more than once. When worn properly — with the nose clip bent to fit snugly to the nose — they form an effective barrier against some particles. However, because of the loose fit — and the fact that the material gapes at the sides — they can not protect against all germs. These masks can, however, still be found online, and are also labeled as isolation masks, dental masks, or medical procedure masks. CVS sells packs for 50 for$12.49, and Walmart sells packs of 20 for $2.97. Amazon also has several options ranging in price, though most delivery estimates are for May. Cycling masks While cycling masks remain untested regarding coronavirus, they are intended to provide a layer of protection from airborne particles. They are designed to stop cyclists breathing in pollution when they ride through areas with heavy traffic. They contain an air filter for this purpose, but are not regulated to the same standard as medical face masks so provide varying levels of protection. These can greatly range in price, from just $7.20 for a Wolfbike Anti-Pollution City Cycling Mask on Amazon to $44 for a Vogmaskdesign. But like N95 and surgical masks, these are hard to come by, with sporting good stores that would normally carry them sold out. Though some are still available for purchase — particularly from websites like Amazon, which allow for third-party sellers — estimated ship dates go as far out as June, with some brands admitted they don't know when they'll be able to fulfill orders. Respirator gas mask Perhaps the most dramatic-looking option of all masks is the gas mask respirator. These are generally used by people spraying paint or other chemicals that would be dangerous to inhale, or those who are working in hazardous environments. The masks have built-in valves fitted with filters, which may be able to keep out droplets carrying the coronavirus. RDDUSA, a military surplus site, has options from $69.90 to $184.70. Amazonhas various gas masks for as low as $16.99, but it's unclear how effective they are Meanwhile,MIRA Safety is selling military-grade options, including onedeveloped in cooperation with Czech Army specialists for $229.95. Cloth masks Since the outbreak began and masks started flying off the shelves, several big brand, smaller brands, and brand-new brands have started making their own face masks out of fabric. Designer Alice + Oliviais selling protective masks with her iconic 'Staceface' pattern for just $10, with pre-orders expected to ship at the end of the month. Kenny Flowers has three-packs for $24 which will also ship later this month, while Citizens of Humanity's $25 five-pack are estimated to ship the week of April 20. Meanwhile, Birdwell Beach Britchesis doing a 'buy one, give on' program from $19.95: For each mask purchased, the brand will donate one toCORE, a non-profit providing free drive-through testing for high-risk individuals. Dozens of others brands are making masks in a variety of styles, prints, and colors, while countless Etsysellers are offering their own homemade versions. Of course, these masks are not medial-grade, and may not be effective in close contact with someone carrying the virus — so other precautions like social distancing and limited trips outside should still be strictly ovserved. And because these masks are reusable, they should be washed regularly. T-shirts, bandanas, and scarves Many people are opting to make masks at home using cloth or other materials. Helpfully, the CDC has published ahow-to guide for people to make their own out of t-shirts or bandanas. These masks are unlikely to prevent someone from catching the virus, but they could stop them from spreading it. Since people who are infected may not show symptoms, widespread use of masks of any kind can help slow down the spread. While European researchers have suggested that these may not be effective — saying that up to 90 per cent of particles can make their way through the fabric — many officials are taking a 'better safe than sorry' approach. To that end, the CDC has offered these guidelines for a homemade mask: They should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, be secured with ties or ear loops, include multiple layers of fabric, allow for breathing without restriction, and be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape."
"A pair of scientists believe that up to 270,000 residents of California have the novel coronavirus, 10 times more cases than have been reported. The researchers estimate that up to 4.8 percent of the total US population was infected with the virus by April 6 - 40 times the number of confirmed cases. They also suggest that almost 50 percent of New Yorkers, which comes out to around nine million people, are likely infected, reported the San Francisco Chronicle. If true, the study would uphold the belief by some in the medical community that a group of asymptomatic and untested carriers are infecting others. However, there have been assurances from both states' officials - Governor Gavin Newsom of California and Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York - that they are 'flattening the curve.' Additionally, local health experts disagree and told the Chronicle that they're skeptical because the model is based on incomplete data. The authors of the study are Dayton Thorpe, a data scientist from San Francisco, and Kelsey Lyberger, a doctoral candidate in population biology at the University of California, Davis. For the report, which was viewed by The Chronicle but has not yet been published, the pair extrapolated death and infection percentages from US citizens repatriated from China. They calculated the number of Americans infected across the country as 39 times higher than the 633,000 reported. Additionally, the researchers determined that the death rate was 0.8 percent, which is eight times deadlier than the seasonal flu. 'There are more cases than I thought,' Thorpe told the Chronicle. 'That is absolutely a concern. The virus is in more people and in more places' than anybody believes. Researchers also confirmed that New York is the worst-hit state but that it's infection rate is closer to 46 percent and not the 1.09 percent recorded. 'The estimated value in New York is so high that it is likely close to herd immunity,' Thorpe and Lyberger wrote, according to the Chronicle. Herd immunity occurs when so many people become infected - or vaccinated - that a disease cannot spread because the majority of the population is immune. No other state has reached such a level. Behind New York was New Jersey, with an estimated 16 of the population infected, and in third was Louisiana with an estimated 10 percent of residents infected. As of Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases of the virus in the US was 633,000, according toJohns Hopkins University. The team estimates the true number is closer to 15.8 million. Thorpe and Lyberger said their calculations are not far-fetched, telling the Chronicle it's the same method used by an Imperial College of London study. In that study, researchers predicted that two million Americans would die of social distancing measures were not put in place. But their colleagues don't necessarily agree. Dr Joseph Lewnard, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health told the Chronicle the new study 'doesn't pass the smell test.' 'Even if the situation seems to have come under control earlier in California, it is highly suspect that the cumulative infections would be roughly 100 times higher in New York than in California,' Lewnard told the newspaper. 'For a virus that first emerged in humans around December 2019 in China, it is very hard to picture that there have been enough generations of spread to result in nine million infections in New York alone, given what we know about transmissibility.'"
"The Internal Revenue Service's online tool that helps Americans track their $1,200 stimulus checks has gone into meltdown just hours after it launched. Frustrated users took to social media Wednesday to blast the highly-anticipated tracker, reporting that the site is crashing or telling them that it can't find their details. More ludicrous still, payments have been sent to people who have been dead for two years, while thousands in need complain they haven't received the much-needed handout. But the IRS bizarrely claimed that their website was 'operating smoothly and effectively' despite the complaints of taxpayers online. The latest blow comes as Americans already face delays in getting the$1,200 government stimulus checks, after it emerged Tuesday that PresidentDonald Trumphas ordered that hisname be printed on the checks, slowing their delivery by several days. With nearly 17 million Americans filing for unemployment in the last three weeks and the joblessrate reaching its highest point since 1940, millions of households across the nation are desperately waiting to access the federal aid. But while Americans on the breadline report their bank accounts still sitting empty, hundreds of people on social media have spoken out about checks being paid into dead relatives accounts. 'Deceased people are receiving stimulus checks today. My grandmother passed away in 2018 — and $1,200 was deposited in her bank account today,' one person posted on Twitter. US Representative Thomas Massie posted a photo of a text from a friend which read: 'Dad got his stimulus check of $1200. He died in [redacted] 2018. Does he have to spend it online?' In at least two cases in South Carolina, the IRS sent checks to people who died months ago. Two separate bereaved relatives told Fits News that checks had arrived for their dead family members. 'My father-in-law died just before Christmas last year,' one person said, noting that the man's bank account had received the $1,200 boost from the government. Meanwhile, one woman said a check had landed into her mother's account - who diedaround Thanksgiving. 'I can't believe all deceased people would get a check!' she told Fit News. Widows and widowers are reporting payments for two checks - one for them and one for their deceased partners. Alongside the emotional toll that the blunder is taking, questions are being asked over whether they have to return the payments. 'My mom got two stimulus checks (one for her the other for my dad who is deceased). He passed in 2018 and she hasn't filed single yet on 2019's taxes. Long story short, does she have to give that extra $1200 back?' one person Tweeted. The online tracker Get My Payment was finally launched Wednesday but is reportedly already buckling under the demand, with taxpayers citing a series of glitches with the tool. Several social media posts complained of the site crashing as they tried to find out when they will receive the cash injection. 'The IRS 'Get my Payment' site keeps going down for technical difficulty,' one person posted on Twitter, adding that there was 'no way to contact IRS on the site'. Other Twitter users said they had managed to access the site and fill in their details but the tool then could find no information about their checks. Several complained that they are getting a message saying: 'Payment Status Not Available. According to information that we have on file, we cannot determine your eligibility for a payment at this time.' The message has sparked mounting concerns that some people have been missed out of the stimulus package or may have been incorrectly deemed ineligible. One person Tweeted:Did anyone else NOT get their #Stimulusdeposit and then receive this message when they checked they status on the IRS site?' Many people responded to the Tweet saying they have faced the same issue. 'Same here and I just got my small 2019 tax refund yesterday deposited in my bank acct as I am single, make way below the guideline, just deposited my 2019 refund into my bank acct so wtf!!!,' one person posted. Another told how she had been out of work for weeks and was left in tears over fears she is not receiving the check and still has no money. 'Same!! WTH? I cried and cried. I've been out of work and out of money for weeks already. I don't understand. I should qualify too,' they Tweeted. Another person slammed the tool a 'joke'. 'Yo @IRSnews your get my payment site is a joke,' they Tweeted. 'Don't launch something that's not going to work for 95% of the people trying to use it.' One person Tweeted: 'Hey @IRS and @realDonaldTrump gimme my money u clowns.' But the IRS said in a statement that the site was operating 'smoothly', and that more than a million people had been able to upload their bank details. A statement online read: 'As of mid-day today, more than 6.2 million taxpayers have successfully received their payment status and almost 1.1 million taxpayers have successfully provided banking information, ensuring a direct deposit will be quickly sent. 'IRS is actively monitoring site volume; if site volume gets too high, users are sent to an online “waiting room” for a brief wait until space becomes available, much like private sector online sites.'  In situations where payment status is not available, the app will respond with “Status Not Available”. The IRS reminds users you may receive this message for one of the following reasons: Source: irs.gov People in desperate need of the funds have also slammed the system over when the checks are paid, after they have been missed out of the first payment run. One person Tweeted that they have not received their check despite losing their job while people still in paid employment have been among the first to get them. 'Everyone I know who still has a well-paying job received their stimulus check today. Meanwhile, I haven't worked in an entire month and this is what the government has for me. #Stimulusdeposit #Stimuluscheck #IRSDirectDeposit,' they posted. One user simply said: 'Me checking my bank account for the 100th time seeing that it still ain't been stimulated #Stimulusdeposit' alongside a meme of a fist-shaking. Some luckier people told how they have seen the payments hit their accounts. 'I got my Democratic Party stimulus today. Thanks to all the Democrats who stood up for us to make sure we got something. We appreciate your hard work! #Stimulusdeposit #Stimuluscheck Keep working hard for the people!,' one happy person Tweeted. But even some of the people who have received payments have complained that the value has been incorrectly calculated. President Trump said that more than 80 million would receive their direct deposits by Wednesday. The first checks from the stimulus were sent out by the IRS this week, meaning a large majority of eligible Americans' should receive the payments by April 24. As Americans wait for their $1,200 payments, they can turn to the new online tool to track them. However, as well as the reported technical issues with the online portal, millions are also allegedly facing delays due to the president's insistence his name is branded on the checks. Citing administration officials, the Washington Post reported earlier this week that the Treasury Department has ordered Trump's name be printed on the checks, slowing their delivery by several days. The president had reportedly first privately suggested to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who oversees the IRS, that he formally sign the checks. But the president is not an authorized signer for legal disbursements by the Treasury and so the request was denied. Instead, the checks will carry the signature of an official with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the Treasury Department division that prints the checks, and Trump's name will be printed on them. The report drew allegations that Trump is trying to use the stimulus checks to boost his re-election bid, by giving voters the impression that he is personally responsible for the relief payments. The White House and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. So far, there have been more than 633,000 confirmed cases in the US of the coronavirus, which has been blamed for more than 27,000 deaths. Federal officials hope to reverse the historic economic impact of the flu-like virus, also known as COVID-19, which has resulted in layoffs and furloughs of Americans across the country, with an approved $2.2 trillion stimulus package. The package was designed to aid both corporate America, small business, as well as Americans who are struggling to make ends meet while waiting for the outbreak to run its course. Individuals earning more than $99,000 and couples without children whose income exceeds $198,000 are not eligible. Payments start phasing out for Americans with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000 and married couples earning more than $150,000. The amount will reduced by $5 for every additional $100 of adjusted gross income. Where's my check? To track the stimulus payments, the IRS made its tracking tool available on Wednesday. Users must enter a Social Security number, date of birth and mailing address in order to track their payment. The site will respond with a payment status, type and requests for more information, including bank account details, if needed. Americans who filed their 2018 and 2019 taxes, as well as the lowest earners, should be among the first to receive their checks, the IRS has said, reports CNN. People who haven't been required to file a return for those two years will likely have to enter additional information online. Social Security recipients will also receive their payments first. Aside from the potential for delays because of the president's request to have his signature on the checks, millions of Americans also may not see their payment sooner because they didn't authorize direct deposit. The Treasury has set up its own new web portal, where updated information can be entered. What else can I do if I don't get my check The Get My Payment tool will allow taxpayers to input their bank account information so they can receive their payment electronically, as opposed to a paper check that might take weeks, or even months. Low-income earners who did not make more than $12,200 last year or married couples who did not earn more than $24,400, and who do not normally file tax returns will have to take several actions to get their payments. Most will be able to provide the required information with the new online tool, which is very'very straightforward, and likely much faster, than requiring non-filers to fill out and submit a tax form,' Erica York, an economist at the Tax Foundation, tells CNN. Alerting those persons is the challenge, especially for those who do not have access to the internet, she said."
"A crash federal government lending program meant to speed money into the hands of businesses hard hit by the coronavirus downturn is nearing its $349 billion statutory limit less than two weeks after it began. The federal government is on the verge of the lending limit on its Paycheck Protection Program that is funneling relief money to the nation's struggling small businesses amid a stunning jump in unemployment. The Small Business Administration says that as of Wednesday afternoon, it had approved nearly 1.38 million loans totaling more than $301 billion – up more than $50 billion since Monday. The Trump administration has asked Congress, which set the original ceiling, for another $250 billion for the program. However, that request has stalled in the Senate. More than 16 million Americans filed for unemployment during the last three weekly filing periods. An email sent to the SBA for information about the agency's next steps after the lending limit is reached was not immediately answered. It's unclear how much money has actually been distributed from the program, which only launched April 3. Thousands of business owners are still awaiting word on their loan applications. The average loan size is $240,000, according to the SBA. However neither the Treasury Department nor the agency overseeing the lending program have put out detailed information about the taxpayer-backed loans, which are administered by banks. An administration official told CNBCthe information is not available. The loan money is contained in a $2 trillion coronavirus bailout law. When it was announced late last month, SBA administrator Jovita Carranza said in a statement: 'Speed is the operative word; applications for the emergency capital can begin as early as this week, with lenders using their own systems and processes to make these loans.' Having banks dole out the money was designed to get the funds out to businesses as quickly as possible. The loans are to be completely forgiven, so long as proceeds are used to cover payroll, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities for the two months after the loan is made, according to Treasury Department guidance, and compensation levels are maintained. Businesses getting the loans range from health care to retail to construction. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to reports that the program could run out of funds today. Democrats are negotiating with the administration on a deal toprovide $251 billion in new funding for small businesses. 'Democrats know that in order for the Paycheck Protection Program to succeed, it must work for everyone. That is why we have been asking for the Administration to work with us to help' small businesses that are 'underbanked,' state and local governments that are 'desperate,' and front line hospitals, she wrote. “As has been clear since last week, Republicans’ bill which fails to address these critical issues cannot get unanimous consent in the House,' she said, a week after refusing to go along with a stand-alone bill being sought by Republicans. Democrats want a broader deal worth $500 billion dealing with all three areas. "
"A Michigan doctor has claimed he will prove whether or not coronavirus antibodies guarantee immunity to the virus and how long they stay in the body. Dr. Matthew Sims is among a team of doctors from Beaumont Health in Michigan which seeks to test 38,000 of its employees and patients for the antibodies. He says that they will finally answer first how long the antibodies stay in a person's body and whether or not they do give immunity to COVID-19 which is the key to restarting the world's economy. Participants will have their blood tested at least twice over a period of two weeks or more. The team has not yet revealed how they will test whether or not the antibodies actually protect against the virus - ie how they will expose participants to it again. They did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's inquiries. In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, however, Dr. Sims said: 'I am hoping it shows evidence of immunity, most viruses when you get antibodies you get immunity - there's every reason to think they should be protective but until we prove it we don't know. 'This is the study that's going to prove it. 'That's what we hope to do with this. Part of the goal is to figure out how to get people back to work - back to normal life,' he said. It comes amid growing uncertainty surrounding the tests. Arizona on Tuesday said it would provide coronavirus antibody tests for 250,000 health-care workers and first responders in the largest such testing in the United States to date. The blood tests show who has been exposed to the novel coronavirus and successfully built immunity, the University of Arizona, which will produce and carry out the tests, said in a statement. With experts saying that up to 50 percent of people exposed to COVID-19 experience few to no symptoms, determining who has developed virus-fighting antibodies is critical to restarting social interaction, said Dr. Michael Dake, senior vice president for the University of Arizona Health Sciences. 'We're going to be the largest and certainly the first to undertake a statewide testing of all healthcare workers and first responders,' Dake, who is overseeing production of the tests, said on a conference call. Simple blood tests for coronavirus, like Premier Biotech's, work much like pregnancy tests. After the sample of blood is collected, a technician injects it into the analysis device - which is about the size of an Apple TV or Roku remote - along with some buffer, and waits about 10 minutes. The blood droplet and buffer soak into the absorbent strip of paper enclosed in the plastic collection device. Blood naturally seeps along the strip, which is dyed at three points: one for each of two types of antibodies, and a third control line. The strip is marked 'IgM' and 'IgG', for immunoglobulins M and G. Each of these are types of antibodies that the body produces in response to a late- or early-stage infection. Along each strip, the antibodies themselves are printed in combination with gold, which react when the either the antigen - or pathogen, in this case, the virus that causes COVID-19 - or the antibody to fight are present. Results are displayed in a similar fashion to those of an at-home pregnancy test. One line - the top, control strip - means negative. Two lines - the top control line and the bottom IgM line - in a spread-out configuration means the sample contains antibodies that the body starts making shortly after infection. Two lines closer - control and IgG - together mean the person is positive for the later-stage antibodies. Three lines mean the patient is positive for both types of antibodies. The state is providing the university $3.5 million in funding to produce the tests and provide results after clinics and hospitals send blood samples of the workers. Dake expected the university to be able to process 5,000 tests per day once the program ramps up to full speed in early May, when some models show Arizona's outbreak peaking. First responders and healthcare workers are the first wave of testing, which may move onto other areas of the population, Dake said. The University of Arizona has pledged to give antibody tests to all 45,000 of its students and 15,000 faculty. The antibody tests, using decades-old ELISA technology, do not always pick up early-stage infections but show whether a person had the virus in the past, even if the person was asymptomatic. In comparison, the so called RT-PCR-technology swab tests used at drive-through stations and clinics across the country determine whether a person has the virus at that moment by looking for it in nose or throat secretions. Both tests are critical in the coronavirus fight, but antibody tests are seen as a relatively cheap, fast means to sort populations into risk groups and measure virus spread. Questions remain about how long coronavirus immunity levels last and whether people who have antibodies could still be contagious, according to some infectious disease specialists. 'Antibody testing is not a cure-all,' Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said in a statement. 'Learning more about it is an important step to identifying community exposure, helping us make decisions about how we protect our citizens, and getting us to the other side of this pandemic.' In Texas, a doctor is offering antibody tests to people who think they had the virus in but could not get a diagnostic test. 'We offer the test for people who may have suspected they might have had coronavirus back in February or March when testing with the nasal swab [and PCR diagnostic test] was very limited,'Dr. Jeremy Gabrysch told NPR. They sell their kits for $49. There are concerns over how accurate the tests will be and if they return false positives which would give false assurances. Doctors say that the more prevalent the disease is in the population, the more likely the tests are to be accurate. But the smaller the prevalence, the greater likelihood false positives. 'It is kind of a strange thing. An antibody test is much more likely to be wrong in a population with very little COVID exposure,' Dr. H. Gilbert Welch told NPR."
"Two Democratic congressmen have proposed expanding the coronavirus relief program to give Americans $2,000 a month until the economy recovers. The checks would go to individuals making less than $130,000 or couples who earn less than $260,000 and would be steady source of income, unlike the first round of individual checks, which, at up to $1,200, were a one-time deposit. The money would cease when unemployment returns to its pre-coronavirus levels. Representatives Tim Ryan of Ohio and Ro Khanna of California said their Emergency Money for the People Act would provide more relief as workers face pay cuts, layoffs and furloughs due to the pandemic's economic effect. Under the plan from Ryan, a moderate Democrat who made a long shot attempt for the presidential nomination that failed, and Khanna, one of the most liberal members of Congress who endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, adults aged 16 and older would be eligible for the $2,000 monthly check. The congressmen note their plan would also include people left out of the first round of stimulus checks, such ascollege students and adults with disabilities who are still claimed as a dependent.  Additionally, there would be a child credit for families that earned less than $260,000 -l $500 per child for up to three children. 'The economic impact of this virus is unprecedented for our country. As millions of Americans file for unemployment week over week, we have to work quickly to patch the dam – and that means putting cash in the hands of hard-working families,' Ryan said in a statement. 'A one-time, twelve hundred dollar check isn't going to cut it,' Khanna said. 'Americans need sustained cash infusions for the duration of this crisis in order to come out on the other side alive, healthy, and ready to get back to work.' It's unclear how much support their legislation would have in Congress, where leadership in both parties are talking about a possible fourth rescue package that could include another round of stimulus checks. Those checks, like the first round, would be one time only. The coronavirus outbreak has thrown at least 16.8 million Americans out of work in just three weeks. More cuts are still expected with economists predicting that more than 20 million Americans may lose jobs this month. The unemployment rate could hit 15 percent when the April employment report is released in early May. The viral outbreak is believed to have erased nearly one-third of the economy's output in the current quarter. About 95 percent, or 48 states, are now under some form of lockdown with non-essential businesses shutting down. Restaurants, hotels, department stores and small businesses have laid off millions as they struggle to pay bills at a time when their revenue has vanished. Additionally, U.S. retail sales plummeted a record 8.7 per cent in March as the coronavirus outbreak forced an almost complete lockdown of commerce nationwide. The unprecedented decline in sales far outpaced the previous record decline of 3.9 per cent that took place during the depths of the Great Recession in November 2008. As of Tuesday night the amount of deaths in the United States from the coronavirus surpassed 26,000 and there are more than 615,000 confirmed cases, which is higher than any other country has reported. In March, President Donald Trump signed the CARES Act – a $2.2 trillion bill that allocated money, loans and grants to several industries, government institutions, small businesses and directly to the American people – in the form of $1,200 direct checks. Democrats claim they need another overarching bill like the one passed at the end of March. Some congressional Republicans have expressed concern about the cost. The first round of stimulus checks are being sent out this week to people whose direct deposit information is on file with the IRS. But those who are scheduled to receive paper checks may face a delay as the Treasury Department scrambled to add President Trump's signature to them. The president reportedly had suggested to he sign the checks, although he is not an authorized signer for legal disbursements by the Treasury. But The Washington Post reported his name will appear in the memo section. Payments start phasing out for Americans with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000 and married couples earning more than $150,000. The amount will reduced by $5 for every additional $100 of adjusted gross income. As the IRS announced the first checks from the stimulus were sent out this week,Treasury officials say that a large majority of eligible Americans' will receive the payments by April 24. "
"The director of the Centers for Disease Control called the World Health Organization 'a great partner' one day after President Trump announced he would halt the group's funding over its coronavirus response. Dr. Robert Redfield appeared on 'CBS This Morning' and refused to say how the funding freeze would impact the world's ability to combat the coronavirus pandemic, saying he'd prefer to leave 'geo-political issues' for those with that expertise. 'WHO has been a long-term and still is a great partner for us,' Redfield said, adding that 'we're continuing to work side by side to do the best that we can to limit the spread of disease and to protect the American people.' CBS News' Anthony Mason brought up comments made by Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, who savaged Trump on Twitter over his decision to cut off funds in order to investigate WHO's coronavirus response. 'Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds,' Gates tweeted early Wednesday morning. 'Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever,' the billionaire added. Following Trump's Tuesday announcement to cut $500million in funding to the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association has condemned his administration for the action. 'During the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating Covid-19 easier,' president Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement Tuesday. She said 'clear and consistent messaging' is key for all parties during a health crisis. 'The public needs to trust that their leaders are being honest and forthcoming and are really working cooperatively to do whatever they can. 'Physicians feel like we're going into this with one arm tied behind our back. And so we really need the administration to use all the levers of the government to get those on the front lines all the support they need,' she added. The US Chamber of Congress also pushed back again the funds cut on Wednesday. 'The Chamber supports a reformed but functional World Health Organization, and US leadership and involvement are essential to ensuring its transparency and accountability going forward,' Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's executive vice president and head of international affairs, said in a statement. 'However, cutting the WHO’s funding during the COVID-19 pandemic is not in US interests given the organization’s critical role assisting other countries — particularly in the developing world — in their response,' he added. Redfield wouldn't address Gates' comments head-on. Trump first flirted with cutting off WHO's funding a week ago, telling reporters that the group's response to the pandemic had been too 'China-centric,' and suggested WHO was engaged in a cover-up. On Tuesday during a Rose Garden press conference, the president made his decision official. He expressed that his biggest beef with WHO was that the organization didn't support a travel ban from China - and he did. 'Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China accelerated the pandemic all around the world,' Trump said. 'The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days.' 'The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures,' Trump said. The president implemented a partial travel ban on incoming flights from China in late January. The WHO generally doesn't support travel bans because it could lead countries to under-report cases of disease anddestabilize economies, while a country is trying to fight an epidemic. 'Although travel restrictions may intuitively seem like the right thing to do, this is not something that WHO usually recommends,' saidTarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson, when discussing the China travel banin late January. 'This is because of the social disruption they cause and the intensive use of resources required,'Jašarević said. The U.S. is the single largest contributor to WHO. The country paid around $893 million to the organization between 2018 and 2019, which made up about 15 per cent of the agency's total budget. The head of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday that he 'regrets' Trump's decision to cut off funding, as he called for 'solidarity' in fighting the coronavirus. 'This is a time for all of us to be united in our common struggle,' Tedros said at a press briefing. Tedros said the WHO is 'fighting the pandemic with every ounce of our soul and spirit' and will 'continue to do that until the end' - but said its management of the disease would be reviewed by member states 'in due course.' Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for Beijing's foreign ministry, said the global battle against the pandemic is at a 'critical moment' and that suspending funding will 'undermine international cooperation against the epidemic.' Gates wasn't alone in his criticism. Democrats, generally, disapproved of the action, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying Trump made the decision to pass on the blame. 'This is another case, as I have said, of the president's ineffective response, that a weak person, a poor leader, takes no responsibility,' she said. 'A week person blames others.' The American Medical Association also slammed Trump's action. 'During the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating Covid-19 easier,' AMA President Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement Tuesday. 'Physicians feel like we're going into this with one arm tied behind our back. And so we really need the administration to use all the levers of the government to get those on the front lines all the support they need,' she added. UN Secretary GeneralAntónio Guterres said now 'is not the time to reduce th resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organization in the fight against the virus.' So far Trump's political allies in Congress were on board. 'This is a critical time for worldwide public health and we cannot afford China apologists running the WHO,' Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said in a press release. 'Isupport a suspension of funding by the United States until there is new leadership at the WHO.' A number of Congressional Republicans had previously called on Tedros to resign. Trump didn't go that far, yet. At the Tuesday press conference he didn't call for new leadership of WHO. 'We're doing an investigation,' the president answered to a question about a Tedros ouster. 'I don't know the gentleman, but I know there's been problems.'

"Numerous major U.S. airlines are preparing to apply this week for a $25 billion U.S. government loan program after winning billions in federal payroll grants, people familiar with the matter said. The U.S. Treasury told airlines to apply by Friday if they want priority consideration, according to documents posted on its website. An airline official told Reuters most airlines are expected to apply in part because they will not be required to draw down the loan before the end of September and the terms are favorable. American Airlines Group Inc confirmed on Tuesday it plans to apply for a $4.75 billion loan ahead of the Friday deadline set by Treasury for priority consideration. Alaska Airlines Inc said it would apply for $1.1 billion in federal loans. Among other large carriers, United Airlines Holdings Inc and Southwest Airlines Co will also apply, while DeltaAir Lines was still considering it, sources said. Another industry person said all the major carriers would likely apply with the exception of Spirit Airlines. Some airlines had initially planned to tap only the $25 billion in federal payroll grants agreed Tuesday in a deal that could see government take ownership stakes. But there is now a growing realization that the terms of the separate government loan package may be significantly better than those available in capital markets, sources said. The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that major passenger airlines have agreed in principle to a $25 billion rescue package, ensuring airline workers have jobs until October while the industry battles its biggest-ever crisis. Airlines did not want to give up equity, but Treasury demanded compensation for taxpayers. Airlines are hopeful that U.S. passenger traffic, which has dropped by 95 per cent due to the coronavirus pandemic, will begin to recover by October but have warned that the slowdown in air travel could extend into next year and even longer. It's possible they will need another round of government bailouts to survive. Major carriers will receive 70 per cent of the funds for payroll in cash assistance that will not need to be paid back, while smaller carriers receiving $100 million or less will not need to repay any funds. The six largest U.S. airlines - American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines Holdings Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co, JetBlue Airways Corp and Alaska Airlines - as well as four other airlines accepted the support, Treasury said. Agreements should be finalized soon and funds disbursed quickly, it said. Carriers were told they could apply for the total salaries and benefits paid in the second and third quarters of 2019, an amount that surpasses American Airlines' current market value. Under the terms laid out by Treasury officials last week, the government would receive repayment on 30 per cent of the funds awarded to large carriers and warrants equal to 10 per cent of the loan amount that were priced at last week's close. Delta said it will receive $5.4 billion in grants, of which $1.6 billion will be an unsecured 10-year low-interest loan that has to be repaid, and will provide the government with warrants to acquire about 1 per cent of Delta stock at $24.39 per share over five years. American Airlines said it would receive $5.8 billion in grants, of which it would need to repay $1.7 billion. Southwest said it had agreed in principle and expects to receive $3.2 billion in grants and will have to repay nearly $1 billion over 10 years. Southwest will issue 2.6 million warrants to the Treasury. JetBlue said it will receive $935.8 million in payroll grants. Alaska and its regional carrier Horizon Air will receive $992 million in funding, including $267 million in the form of a loan, that the airline expects will cover about 70 per cent of budgeted costs through Sept. 30. Alaska said the Treasury will receive the right to buy 847,000 non-voting shares of parent Alaska Air Group at a price of $31.61 per share. United was eligible for about $6 billion but did not disclose on Tuesday how much it would receive. Spirit Airlines Inc, a low-cost carrier which was not listed by the Treasury as reaching agreement, said it expects 'to agree on terms soon' for payroll grants. 'We are closer than ever to almost a million airline workers knowing they will receive their paycheck and keep their healthcare and other benefits, at least through September,' said Association of Flight Attendants President Sara Nelson, who is widely credited for the idea of aid specifically for payroll. 'At the same time, we were able to rein in the worst corporate practices by tying this aid to restrictions on stock buybacks, executive compensation and dividends.' According to the statute, companies receiving funds cannot lay off employees before September 30 or change collective bargaining agreements and must agree to restrictions on buybacks, executive compensation and dividends. The statute gave the Treasury the authority to demand compensation for the grants, but did not require it. Estimated global airline losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion, 25 per cent more than previously forecast, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Tuesday.

"The World Heath Organisation has found itself with serious questions to answer after President Trump accused the UN agency of 'severely mismanaging' its response to the coronavirus pandemic and withheld $500million in funding. The WHO has been spearheading global efforts to fight the virus, but has come under attack for playing along with China as the country sought to minimise its initial outbreak and the threat the disease posed. Critics point to its uncritical parroting of Chinese government data, early claims that the disease was not spreading person-to-person, and praise for the country's leaders as evidence that it was not fulfilling its role. Trump - who is facing heavy criticism for his own response - has blasted the WHO for advising against travel bans, which he claims 'accelerated the pandemic all around the world', and called for an investigation. Here, the Mail Online has tracked key WHO statements about coronavirus - from the first cases, through China's outbreak, and beyond - to reveal what the world's largest health body said and when as the disease spread... December 31 – China first reports a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan to the WHO January 4 – WHO tweets about ‘a cluster of pneumonia cases’ in Wuhan with no deaths, saying investigations into the cause are underway January 5– The WHO issues its first guidance on ‘pneumonia of unknown cause’, saying there are a total of 44 patients and 11 in severe condition. The main symptom is listed as fever, with ‘a few patients having difficulty breathing’ The WHO says there is ‘no evidence of human-to-human transmission’ and that ‘no health care worker infections have been reported’ January 7 – China says it has identified the cause of the pneumonia as a ‘novel coronavirus’, initially named 2019-nCoV by the WHO January 9 – The WHO praises China for identifying the new virus ‘in a short space of time’ and repeats its assessment that the virus ‘does not transmit readily between people’. It also advises against travel or trade restrictions on China January 13 – The WHO says it is now working with authorities in Thailand after reports of a case there, and may call a meeting of the Emergency Committee January 14 – The WHO tweets saying there is ‘no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in China’, though later clarifies and says there may have been limited transmission via family members Jan 20-21 - WHO's field team in China conducts a brief field visit to epicentre Wuhan Jan 21 – The first case is confirmed on US soil in Washington, in a person who had travelled from China a week before Jan 22 – A report from the WHO team sent to Wuhan notes ‘human-to-human’ transmission is taking place, but says more research is needed to assess ‘the full extent’. The report notes confirmed infections in 16 medics, a clear sign of transmission from patients The team recommends avoiding large gatherings, isolating infected people, and a focus on washing hands as the best way to combat the virus’s spread The same day, that WHO Emergency Committee convenes for the first time. Afterwards, Dr Tedros says he has spoken with the Chinese Minister for Health, and praises the government for its ‘invaluable’ efforts to halt the virus. He calls a second meeting for the following day Jan 23 – With the Emergency Committee split, Dr Tedros says he has decided not to declare the virus a public health emergency of international concern. Referencing the lockdown of Wuhan, which was announced the same day, he says he hopes ‘it will be effective and short in duration’. He praises China’s ‘cooperation and transparency’ in tackling the virus Dr Tedros says there is limited evidence of human-to-human transmission, mostly among families or doctors treating the virus. At this point, there are 584 confirmed cases and 17 deaths globally, including in Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, Thailand and the US He recommends screening at airports and tells countries to put testing facilities in place, but stops short of recommending a travel ban Jan 28 – Dr Tedros and other senior WHO officials meet Xi Jinping in China, agreeing that a panel of experts should be sent to monitor the outbreak. He praises ‘the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership and the transparency they have demonstrated’ Jan 29 – Dr Tedros gives a speech praising China’s efforts to contain the virus, saying the country ‘deserves our gratitude and respect’ for locking down swathes of the country to prevent the spread. He notes a few cases of human-to-human spread outside China, which he says ‘is of grave concern’ and will be monitored closely Jan 30 – The WHO Emergency Committee reconvenes early and declares a public health emergency of international concern. It comes after confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission in Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the US Dr Tedros again praises China for ‘setting a new standard for outbreak response’ with its lockdowns, and says the small number of cases outside the country – 98 – is ‘thanks to their efforts’ Despite noting that a majority of cases outside China have a history of travel to or from Wuhan, he again recommends no measures to curb international travel or trade Jan 31 – Donald Trump announces travel restrictions on people coming from China Feb 3 – Dr Tedros gives a speech to the WHO updating on coronavirus, saying there are 17,238 cases in China and 361 deaths – now thought to be an under-estimate He praises Xi Jinping for his individual leadership, and insists that cases outside China ‘can be managed’ if world authorities work together and follow recommendations which include – no ban on travel or trade, supporting countries with weak health systems, investment in vaccines and diagnosis, combating disinformation and urgent reviews of emergency preparedness Feb 7 – Dr Li Wenliang, a doctor who first reported the existence of coronavirus and was initially silenced by China, dies from the virus Feb 10 – The WHO’s team of experts arrives in China to assist with the outbreak Feb 11 – The WHO names the disease caused by the virus COVID-19, saying it avoided including a geographical name because it risks ‘stigmatizing’ people. It says it will not be using the name SARS-CoV-2 because it risks causing ‘unnecessary fear’ by linking it to the 2003 SARS outbreak Feb 12 – Dr Tedros says the number of new cases being reported in China has ‘stabilised’ but adds that it must be ‘interpreted with extreme caution’ and the outbreak ‘could still go in any direction’ Feb 16-24 – WHO team of experts convenes in China, visiting affected sites and sharing information on the best ways to tackle the crisis Feb 17 – Dr Tedros begins chairing daily updates on the coronavirus response, with each briefing beginning with an update on the number of infections including from China, which are repeated without caveats He give an analysis of Chinese data on some 44,000 confirmed cases. He says the data shows that 80 per cent of cases are mild, 14 per cent lead to severe disease, and 2 per cent are fatal. The disease is more severe in older people, with the young largely spared. He urges world leaders not to ‘squander’ a window of opportunity to get ahead of the virus and prevent it from spreading Feb 26 – Donald Trump announces a dedicated coronavirus response team, which Mike Pence will lead Feb 28 – The team of WHO experts delivers its first report on the coronavirus. Among its major findings are that the disease likely came from bats, that it is spread through close contact with infected people and not through the air, and that most common symptoms include fever, dry cough and fatigue The report praises China’s response as ‘perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history’ saying lockdowns were achieved ‘due to the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action’ and had achieved a rapid decline in cases Mar 9 - The whole of Italy is placed on lockdown as the virus spreads, the first European nation to enter total lockdown Mar 11 - The WHO declares coronavirus a pandemic, meaning it is spreading out of control in multiple locations around the world. At this point, cases have been reported in more than 100 countries Mar 13 - WHO says Europe is now the new epicentre of the virus after cases increase steeply, with Dr Tedros noting ‘more cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic’ Mar 19- China reports no new domestic infections from coronavirus since the pandemic began Mar 20 - Dr Tedros issues a warning that 'young people are not invincible' to the virus after data from outside showed large numbers of people under the age of 50 ending up in intensive care Mar 25 - As Donald Trump begins touting hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment, WHO warns that no drugs have so far been approved for treating the virus The same day the organization calls for an extra $2billion in funding to help tackle the virus Apr 3 - As millions of US citizens sign on for unemployment benefit, Dr Tedros and the IMF call for debt relief and social welfare to help people through the pandemic Apr 6- The WHO updates its guidance on masks to say they are effective at stopping spread of the virus, but must be used in conjunction with other methods. It comes after the CDC updated its guidance to advise people to wear masks in public Apr 8 - Following Trump's first barrage of criticism for the WHO, Dr Tedros urges world leaders to 'stop politicising the pandemic' unless they want 'more body bags' Apr 13 - A group of scientists convened by WHO to research a vaccine for coronavirus issue a joint statement urging world leaders to keep listening to the scientific community when responding to the virus"
"Nancy Pelosi railed against Donald Trump in a 'dear colleague' letter sent to Democrats Tuesday, blaming the current situation in the U.S. in the midst of the coronavirus crisis on the president. 'In order to move forward, we must first understand the truth of what has put us in this position,' the House Speaker wrote before diving into a series of problems she blames on Trump, calling it 'the truth.' 'The truth is that Donald Trump told his most loyal followers that the pandemic was a hoax and that it would magically disappear, thus endangering lives and paving the way for economic disaster,' she listed, insisting he ignored warnings of the coronavirus threat earlier this year. Pelosi also laid out in the letter that she believes Trump's presidential actions are the reason coronavirus hit the U.S. as hard as it has and caused so much economic disaster and financial hardships for Americans. 'Donald Trump dismantled the infrastructure handed to him which was meant to plan for and overcome a pandemic, resulting in unnecessary deaths and economic disaster,' she wrote. 'The truth is a weak person, a poor leader, takes no responsibility. A weak person blames others,' the California Democrat continued. Democrats were able to block a measure last week from Republicans requesting unanimous consent for a $250 billion expansion of the payment protection program (PPP) for small businesses to avoid stuttering and keep their employees on the payroll. Pelosi claimed her Party would not allow the interim provision to pass because it did not include a list of measures Democrats demanded be included. Although Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the other measures should be included in part two of the CARES Act, Democratic leadership said other provisions are more urgent than the PPP and require immediate attention. Pelosi asserts one of these necessary additions is an expansion of testing availability. 'The President continues to obfuscate, saying we have more testing than any other country in the world. The truth is that only 1 percent of Americans have been tested,' she wrote. 'The failure to test is central to the spread of the virus and its impact on those most vulnerable in our society. The failure to test is dangerous and deadly, and without testing, we cannot resume our lives.' As of Tuesday night the amount of deaths surpassed 26,000 and there are more than 615,000 confirmed cases, which is higher than any other country has reported. Experts analyses show the pandemic is likely to reach its peak in the U.S. this week, but some claim there could be a resurgence of the virus in the fall or winter. Pelosi is also demanding that the next bill include billions for an increase in production and distribution of testing sets, masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare centers, hospitals and healthcare professionals. In March, Trump signed the CARES Act – a $2.2 trillion bill that allocated money, loans and grants to several industries, government institutions, small businesses and directly to the American people – in the form of $1,200 direct checks. Democrats claim they need another overarching bill like the one passed at the end of March. Due to the coronavirus crisis the once record-breaking economy has spiraled and unemployment claims reached an all-time-high this month after more than 15 million people filed for the benefits in three weeks. Pelosi blames the economic repercussions of the virus on Trump and his handling of the outbreak from the start. 'The truth is because of an incompetent reaction to this health crisis, the strong economy handed to Donald Trump is now a disaster, causing the suffering of countless Americans and endangering lives,' she said. Trump holds nearly-daily press briefings with his White House coronavirus task force, which are nationally televised and attended by a controlled number of members of the media. Pelosi has done her best to run counter-programming to the president's seemingly limitless air-time by appearing in virtual interviews with networks almost every day – sometimes from her home in San Francisco. Dear Democratic Colleague, This Easter Weekend provided me with a time for deeper prayer and reflection. This is an unbearably sad time with all Americans sharing the same devastating experience: we are grieving for those who have died from the coronavirus, we are fearful for our health and especially the health of our loved ones and we are heartbroken for our children who are unable to be in school and with their friends. As Americans, we are suffering from pressures of economic hardship. All of us want to resume the precious and beautiful lives that America’s unique freedoms provide. We will overcome this moment, but success requires one fundamental from which all actions will follow: we need the truth. To succeed in this crisis, we must insist on the truth, and we must act upon it! In order to move forward, we must first understand the truth of what has put us in this position: The truth is, from this moment on, Americans must ignore lies and start to listen to scientists and other respected professionals in order to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Here’s more that is true: the American people want us to work together. In March, Congress passed three bipartisan bills to address this crisis. The first bill passed the House on March 4 and focused on testing, testing, testing. The truth is, one month later, we do not have appropriate testing. The President continues to obfuscate, saying we have more testing than any other country in the world. The truth is that only 1 percent of Americans have been tested. The failure to test is central to the spread of the virus and its impact on those most vulnerable in our society. The failure to test is dangerous and deadly, and without testing, we cannot resume our lives. The President has said that we are engaged in a war. Leaders understand that in war, force protection of our troops is the top priority. In this war, force protection means for health care, police, fire, EMS, food and other essential workers to have the protective equipment that they need to save lives without risking their own. The truth is that we do not have the necessary hospital equipment. Without ventilators and other equipment, our health care workers cannot save the lives of those they serve. Once we all share the truth of what took place and what is currently happening, including in our minority communities, we can work together to solve these problems. There are important decisions ahead. We can go forward confident that America, its competent and honest leaders and its people are fully capable of making the right choices and decisions to restore the American greatness that has been squandered. But if we are not working from the truth, more lives will be lost, economic hardship and suffering will be extended unnecessarily and our children will not be safe, happy and learning. Our future will be healthy and prosperous if we no longer tolerate lies and deceit. We must recognize the truth, we must speak the truth, we must insist on the truth and we must and will act upon it. Respectfully and sadly,"
"Three whistle-blowers who tried to inform the world about the true scale of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan are still missing two months after vanishing from the public sight. The whereabouts of Chen Qiushi, Fang Bing and Li Zehua have been a mystery since February, and Chinese officials have not publicly commented on them. The three citizen journalists had sought to expose the true scale of the outbreak from the then epicentre by uploading videos to YouTube and Twitter, both banned in mainland China. All of their dispatches revealed a grim side of Wuhan unseen on state-run Chinese media outlets. Chen, 34, has not been heard from since 7pm local time on February 6. He arrived in Wuhan just before the city went into lockdown in hopes of providing the world with the truth of the epidemic, as he said himself. His reports detailed horrific scenes including a woman frantically calling family on her phone as she sits next to a relative lying dead in a wheelchair and the helpless situation of patients in the overstretched hospitals. He had been planning to visit a 'fang cang' makeshift hospital before evaporating. His disappearance was revealed by a post on his Twitter account, which has been managed by a friend authorised to speak on his behalf. His mother has posted a video calling for his safe return. The latest post on his Twitter, posted on Wednesday, read: 'Who can tell us where and how Chen Qiushi is right now? When will anyone get to speak with him again? Chen Qiushi has been out of contact for 68 days after covering coronavirus in Wuhan. Please save him!!!' Fang Bin, a Wuhan resident, went missing on February 9 after releasing a series of videos, including one showing piles of bodies being loaded into a bus. He had been arrested arrested briefly before disappearing, it is alleged. His last video showed hazmat-donning officers knocking on his door to measure his body temperature. Fang is seen in the video trying to fend off the officers by telling them his temperature is normal, according to Radio Free Asia (RFA). Li Zehua, 25, is the youngest of the three and the most high-profile reporter. A former employee of state broadcaster CCTV, Li was reporting from Wuhan independently. He was said to be last heard on February 26. Before that, he had visited a series of sensitive venues in Wuhan, such as the community that held a huge banquet despite the epidemic and the crematorium which was hiring extra staff to help carry corpses, RFA added. The news outlet said Li was likely targeted by secret police after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The £34million institute has been at the centre of conspiracy theories, which suggest that the killer virus originated there. A US congressman recently called on the State Department to urge China to investigate the disappearance of the three journalists. In a letter dated March 31, Republican Representative Jim Banks asked the US government to seek a probe into the fates of Chen, Fang and Li. 'All three of these men understood the personal risk associated with independently reporting on coronavirus in China, but they did it anyway,' Banks wrote, alleging that the Chinese government 'imprisoned them - or worse'. Chen, Fang and Li were among several Chinese citizens who were believed to be punished for speaking out about the pandemic. Ren Zhiqiang, a tycoon and prominent Communist party member, went missing after calling President Xi a 'clown' over his handling of the crisis. The 69-year-old is being investigated on suspicion of a 'severe violation of discipline and law', a Chinese authority said last week. An outspoken activist who openly called Chinese President Xi 'not clever enough' and demanded the leader step down over 'the coronavirus catastrophe' could be facing months of torture in secret detention, human rights groups have warned. Xu Zhiyong, a former law lecturer, has allegedly been charged with 'inciting state subversion' after being detained on February 15. The 47-year-old is being kept in a classified location and at 'serious risk' of torture and ill-treatment, according to experts. Ai Fen, a Wuhan doctor who was among the first to alert other medics about the spread of coronavirus was also thought to be detained, reports suggest. The ER doctor said she was safe and working in a short video uploaded to her social media account on Monday. No human-to-human transmission, no travel bans, but plenty of praise for Beijing: How WHO parroted Chinese lies as coronavirus pandemic unfolded By Chris Pleasance for MailOnline The World Heath Organisation has found itself with serious questions to answer after President Trump accused the UN agency of 'severely mismanaging' its response to the coronavirus pandemic and withheld $500million in funding.

"The Pentagon's inspector general on Wednesday said it could not determine whether the White House influenced the award of a $10 billion contract to Microsoft Corp over Amazon after several officials said their conversations were privileged 'presidential communications.' Known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, the cloud computing contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations. 'We could not definitively determine the full extent or nature of interactions that administration officials had, or may have had, with senior DoD officials regarding the JEDI Cloud procurement because of the assertion of a ""presidential communications privilege,""' the report said, referring to the Department of Defense by its acronym. Amazon, originally considered to be the favorite to win the award, has blamed President Donald Trump for bias against the company and for improperly pressuring the Pentagon. The report leaves open the question of whether Trump improperly influenced one of the most closely watched procurement contracts given its size and the high-profile nature of the bidders. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Defense Department said the report 'should finally close the door on the media and corporate-driven attacks on the career procurement officials' involved with JEDI. Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday's announcement. Amazon filed a lawsuit in November, weeks after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Amazon has said the Defense Department's decision to give the contract to Microsoft was full of 'egregious errors,' which were a result of 'improper pressure from President Donald Trump.' Trump, who has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the giant online retailer, has accused the Washington Post, owned by Bezos, of unfair coverage. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has rejected that there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence. Microsoft said in a statement on Wednesday: 'It's now apparent that Amazon bid too high a price and is seeking a do-over so it can bid again.' In the inspector general's report, former Defense Secretary James Mattis was specifically asked about an excerpt from his former staff member's book that said the president told Mattis to 'screw Amazon' out of a chance to bid on the JEDI cloud contract. Mattis told the inspector general that he 'cannot confirm' the former staff member's account and added, 'I don't recall the president´s words on this (JEDI),' the report said. The report also substantiated an allegation of ethical misconduct on the part of a Pentagon employee involved in the procurement process. The employee failed to disclose that he was negotiating a job with Amazon while working on JEDI. He eventually was hired by Amazon. But the report said that, given the employee's minimal contributions to the JEDI procurement process, the ethical misconduct did not influence the outcome. The report was published by the acting Pentagon Inspector General, Sean O'Donnell, whose predecessor Glenn Fine was fired last week by Trump."
"When world-famous artist David Hockney wrote a letter to the Daily Mail saying he believes smoking could protect people against the coronavirus many scoffed. Mr Hockney wrote: 'Could it not be that smokers have developed an immune system to this virus? With all these figures coming out, it’s beginning to look like that to me.' Understandably the claim was brushed off as laughable and 'rubbish' by many. But is it? A leading infectious disease expert at University College London, Professor Francois Balloux, said there is 'bizarrely strong' evidence it could be true. And data from multiple Chinese studies shows that COVID-19 hospital patients contained a smaller proportion of smokers than the general population (6.5 per cent compared to 26.6 per cent),suggesting they were less likely to end up in hospital. Another study, by America's Centers for Disease Control of over 7,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus, found that just 1.3 per cent  of them were smokers - against the 14 per cent of all Americans that the CDC says smoke. The study also found that the smokers stood no greater chance of ending up in hospital or an ICU. The reasons for this are unclear. Evidence coming out of scientific studies is conflicting and some say doctors are just too busy to be accurately noting down everyone's smoking habits. Some researchers suggest smoking could reverse one of the ways in which COVID-19 damages the lungs while others argue thelung damage caused by smoke makes the organs more susceptible to failure. Governments in both the UK and US urge people to stop smoking to protect themselves from the virus, but scientists admit there is no clear proof cigarettes can worsen the disease. I USED to joke that being a smoker in Malibu was the equivalent of being a non-smoker in Pasadena. They used to have very bad pollution there. Could it not be that smokers have developed an immune system to this virus? With all these figures coming out, it’s beginning to look like that to me. I’m serious — and remember cigars and cigarettes are vegan. David Hockney, Normandy. In his letter, Mr Hockney wrote: 'I used to joke that being a smoker in Malibu was the equivalent of being a non-smoker in Pasadena. They used to have very bad pollution there. 'Could it not be that smokers have developed an immune system to this virus? With all these figures coming out, it’s beginning to look like that to me.' The British artist, now 82 and living in France, adds 'I'm serious' and has in the past revealed he's smoked for more than 60 years but still considers himself healthy. Around 1.1billion people around the world smoke cigarettes in spite of evidence they cause lung cancer, heart disease and numerous other life-threatening illnesses. Whether they make people more likely to end up in hospital or die if they catch COVID-19, however, is unclear. A studypublished earlier this month by scientists in New York and Athens claims the opposite. It looked at 13 Chinese studies that had registered smoking as a precondition and found that the number of smokers across the whole sample of 5,300 patients was 6.5 per cent. An astonishingly small number in country where half of all men still smoke. 'This preliminary analysis does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-19,' it reads. 'Instead, these consistent observations, which are further emphasized by the low prevalence of current smoking among COVID-19 patients in the US (1.3 per cent), raises the hypothesis that nicotine may have beneficial effects on COVID-19.' ACE-2 receptors are structures found on the surface of cells in the lungs and airways which work with an enyzme called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) to regulate blood pressure. Its exact function in the lungs is not well understood but studies suggest it is protective against lung damage and low levels of it can worsen the impact of viral infections. Scientists say that the coronavirus which causes COVID-19 enters the body through the ACE-2 receptor, which the shape of it allows it to latch on to. This means that someone with more ACE-2 receptors may be more susceptible to a large viral load - first infectious dose of a virus - entering their bloodstream. People who have higher than usual numbers of ACE-2 receptors may include those with diabetes or high blood pressure because they have genetic defects which make them produce more. Emerging evidence shows that smokers may also produce more. High levels of ACE-2 receptors may also be protective, however. They are thought to be able to protect the lungs during infection and a study on mice in 2008 found that mice which had ACE-2 blocked in their bodies suffered more damage when they were infected with SARS, which is almost identical to COVID-19. Smoking has in the past been repeatedly linked to lower than normal levels of ACE-2 receptors, potentially increasing the risk of lung damage from COVID-19. The paper has not been reviewed by other scientists and admits that it is based on limited data, but says that nicotine and the coronavirus both interact with the same receptors on cells inside the lungs. It was done by Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos and Dr Anastasia Barbouni, from the University of West Attica in Athens, and Dr Raymond Niaura of New York University. They suggest that while the virus causes lung damage by depleting the numbers of those receptors - known as ACE-2 receptors - smoking can increase the number of them, reversing the effect. ACE-2 receptors, which are found on cells in the airways and lungs, have been said to work as the coronavirus's doorway into the body and to 'facilitate' infection. Therefore having more of them would seem to be a bad thing, but scientists say they have a protective effect in the lungs and low levels are linked to worse damage from viral infection. A2008 study in mice found that getting rid of ACE-2 made the animals more likely to suffer severe breathing difficulties when infected with the SARS virus, which is almost identical to COVID-19. ACE-2's function in human lungs is poorly understood. Dr Farsalinos's study was shared on Twitter by Professor Francois Balloux, director of the genetics institute at University College London. Professor Balloux described the paper as 'puzzling' and added: 'Whilst the study design is far from perfect - and the authors are clear about its limitations - the evidence for a protective effect of smoking (or nicotine) against COVID-19 is bizarrely strong... actually far stronger than for any drug trialled at this stage...' It is a claim that has been emerging around the world. French scientist Professor Jean-François Delfraissy, who is leading a scientific council advising the country's government on COVID-19, said: 'We have something very special with tobacco. 'We have found that the vast majority of serious cases are not smokers, as if (…) tobacco protects against this virus, via nicotine,' French news site Sud Ouest reported. The study by Dr Farsalinos adds by way of explanation: 'It has been observed that decreased ACE-2 availability contributes to lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome development. 'Therefore, higher ACE-2 expression, while seemingly paradoxical, may protect against acute lung injury caused by COVID-19.' This is a disputed area of science - there are studies which show smoking can both increase and decrease the levels of ACE-2 available on someone's lung cells. An increase before infection could allow more of the viruses to get into the body in the first place, making someone more vulnerable to the disease. A paper published by scientists at University College London offers the opposite view to Dr Farsalinos. A team of scientists at Harvard University in Boston and the University of Crete in Greece have reviewed five of the first studies on links between smoking and COVID-19. They found smokers do face a greater risk of suffering complications but others suggested they were less likely to be infected in the first place. In all of the studies, fewer than 15 per cent of the patients were smokers - a figure that clashes with China's smoking rate, which is between 20 and 26 per cent and almost half of men. The review of the evidence, led by Harvard's Dr Constantine Vardavas, was published in the journalTobacco Induced Diseases. Here's what it found: STUDY 1 How many people were involved? 78 patients at 3 hospitals in Wuhan, China How many of them were smokers? Unclear Where were the results published? Chinese Medical Journal What did it find? The patients who progressed to severe illness had a 'significantly' higher number of smokers compared to the patients who got better – 27 per cent compared three per cent STUDY 2 How many people were involved? 1,099 at 552 hospitals across China How many of them were smokers? A total of 12.6 per cent (137) were current smokers and 1.9 per cent (21) were former smokers. Where were the results published? New England Medical Journal  What did it find? Among the 173 patients with severe symptoms, 16.9 per cent (29) were current smokers and 5.2 per cent (nine) were former smokers. In comparison, 11.8 per cent (108) of the 926 with milder symptoms were current smokers, and 1.3 per cent (12) were former smokers. In the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5 per cent were current smokers and 7.6 per cent were former smokers. That was more than twice as high as the proportion of patients who did not need intensive care, 11.8 per cent of whom were current smokers and 1.6 per cent were former smokers. STUDY 3 How many people were involved? 140 in one hospital in Wuhan How many of them were smokers? 6.4 per cent were either current smokers (two) or past smokers (seven). Where were the results published? Allergy What did it find? Among the 58 patients who severely ill, 3.4 per cent (two people) were current smokers and 6.9 per cent (four) were former smokers. In comparison, of the 82 with milder symptoms, none were current smokers and 3.7 per cent (three) were former smokers. STUDY 4: How many people were involved? 191 in two hospitals in Wuhan How many of them were smokers? Six per cent (11 people) were current smokers Where were the results published? The Lancet What did it find? Among those that died (54), nine per cent (five people) were current smokers. Of those who survived, four per cent (six people) were smokers. STUDY 5 How many people were involved? 41 in one hospital in Wuhan How many of them were smokers? Seven per cent (three people) were current smokers Where were the results published? The Lancet What did it find? None of the 13 patients who needed to be admitted to ICU were current smokers. In contrast, 11 per cent (three) of those who did not need intensive care were smokers. It said: 'SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to enter cells through the ACE-2 receptor​. 'Some evidence suggests that gene expression and subsequent receptor levels are elevated in the airway and oral [cells] of current smokers​, thus putting smokers at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. 'Other studies, however, show that nicotine downregulates the ACE-2 receptor.' Professor Jamie Brown, an addiction researcher at UCL and one of the authors who wrote that paper, told MailOnline the link is 'very difficult to understand'. 'Everything we know about other respiratory viruses and comorbidities [health problems] suggests smokers will suffer worse outcomes,' he said. Only recently - a paper published this year claimed to be the first - have scientists started to record that smoking increases ACE-2 levels in the airways. It had previously been reported to reduce levels, something that researchers have linked to worse lung damage in coronavirus infections. While higher levels of the receptor may offer some protection in theory, they also offer more doorways through which the virus can enter the body. The study in the European Respiratory Journal said: 'While the up-regulation of ACE-2 may be useful in protecting the host against acute lung injury, chronically, this may predispose individuals to increased risk of coronavirus infections, which uses this receptor to gain entrance into epithelial cells.' Professor Brown added that, considering how smoking influences other lung infections, he would be 'very surprised' if it didn't make COVID-19 worse. One paper suggested that a reason children appear not to be badly affected, in general, by the coronavirus could be that they have more ACE-2 receptors than adults, but it added there is 'a lack of evidence to show that ACE-2 expression varies with age'. DrFarsalinos and his colleagues' study even suggested that withdrawal symptoms from not being able to smoke in hospital could make cigarette users' symptoms worse. It added: 'Hospitalization for COVID-19 will inevitably result in abrupt withdrawal of nicotine and its beneficial effect linked to this hypothesis in smokers or users of other nicotine products. 'This could, at least partly, explain the association between smoking and COVID-19 severity among hospitalized patients.' The theory of smokers having some level of protection from the virus stems from raw hospital data which suggested only small proportions of seriously-ill patients smoke. Hospitals in China, the US, Germany and France have had hundreds of thousands of coronavirus patients but admitted disproportionately small numbers of smokers. According to the campaign group, Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, early data showed that in Germany six per cent to 21 per cent; and in France six per cent compared to 27 per cent. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US showed that of around 7,000 COVID-19 patients, former smokers were more likely to be hospitalised or taken into intensive care than current smokers. Just 22 of the hospital patients and five of those in intensive care admitted to being smokers, while 45 in hospital and 33 in ICU said they were former smokers. Public Health England has not published any information about the people diagnosed or hospitalised with coronavirus in the UK. Why then, scientists have asked, do smokers make up such a small proportion of patients when there are significantly more of them in the countries? Experts have knocked this theory down and say reporting of who smokes and who doesn't has not been accurate enough. UCL's Professor Brown told MailOnline: 'It's difficult to assess how well smoking status has been recorded in an emerging epidemic and a lot of these people have been too sick to answer or have not replied totally honestly.' He added: 'We know generally smokers tend to come from lower income groups which have poorer access to healthcare... so may be more likely to die in the community.' Professor Paul Hunter, a former NHS doctor and now medicine lecturer at the University of East Anglia, agreed that recording was likely to blame. He told MailOnline: 'One interpretation is that smokers are less likely to end up in hospital. 'But actually it's more of an indication that when you've got doctors who are unbelievably busy they don't complete all of the questioning they would normally do.' Professor Hunter added that the notion smoking could protect people from COVID-19 was 'rubbish', but admitted the ACE-2 receptor link deserved further study. Early data from America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that just 1.3 per cent of people diagnosed with COVID-19 were classified as smokers. From a sample of 7,162 of the nation's earliest patients, just 96 were 'current smokers'. Just 22 out of 1,037 patients in hospital were smokers, along with five out of 457 in intensive care, according to the data. This contrasts sharply with the CDC's statistics that show 14 per cent of all Americans regularly smoke cigarettes. It is not clear whether there is a link between smoking and a lower risk of catching or falling ill with coronavirus, or whether recording of who smokes and who doesn't isn't up to scratch. University College London's Professor Jamie Brown, a tobacco and public health expert, said he expects it to be the latter. He told MailOnline: 'It's really difficult to assess how well smoking status has been recorded in an emerging epidemic and a lot of these people have been too sick to answer or may not have replied totally honestly. 'We know, generally, smokers tend to come from lower income groups which have poorer access to healthcare and may be more likely to die in the commmunity.' A study by New York University found that just five per cent of 4,103 coronavirus hospital patients in the city admitted to being smokers. This was far lower than the 15.5 per cent of smokers in the population there. The same proportion of smokers were found in COVID-19 patients who did not need hospitalisation, suggesting they were less likely to catch the virus or were not being accurately recorded. The New York study is not the first to find a low number of smokers in COVID-19 hospital admissions. One team of experts from Wuhan - where the pandemic began - were mystified after finding smokers were less likely to catch the deadly virus in the first place. Scientists have called for further trials to clarify if smoking poses a real threat, but admit, in general, smokers are more susceptible to infection. Public Health England has warned users face a greater risk because the tiny hairs inside the airways and lungs, which help move pathogens and mucus away, are often damaged by the toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke. The new study was published on the archive site medRxiv and not in a journal. Its authors said: 'Surprisingly, though some have speculated that high rates of smoking in China explained some of the morbidity in those patients, we did not find smoking status to be associated with increased risk of hospitalization or critical illness.' A researcher atCold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, Jason Sheltzer, picked apart Dr Farsalinos paper on Twitter with similar logic, calling the study 'severely flawed'. He said that the measures for what defined a smoker varied across the world and across the multiple other studies that were referenced in the paper. One of them, he said, only classified very heavy smokers and not those with lighter habits. A deeper dive into data, Mr Sheltzer wrote, revealed that smoking actually appeared to be linked to a higher risk of severe infection. He said: 'In order to further investigate, I emailed the authors of some of the studies on COVID-19 in China. One doctor replied that their smoking frequency was so low because some patients were literally too sick to answer the question. 'So... it’s clear that in these studies, the definition of a smoker is neither consistent nor consistently applied. You can’t throw them all on a graph and call it a meta-analysis.' He added: 'In short, I think that this analysis is severely flawed. They’re comparing statistics that shouldn’t be compared. 'I don’t think that there’s any convincing evidence that smoking protects against coronavirus.' Government bodies are adamant that people should not consider the prospect of smoking being protective against the illness, which can be deadly, especially for people who already have health problems. Both Public Health England and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have urged people to stop smoking to protect their health. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month said: 'It is abundantly clear from the research into previous coronaviruses that smoking makes the impact of a coronavirus worse.' And his chief medical adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, added: 'If you are going to give up smoking, this is a very good moment to do it.'"
"1) How essential is the business? Cuomo did not explain how he would determine which businesses were essential and which were not. He said: 'How essential is the business service or product or function, the more essential a business service or product, the more urgent the need to immediately get them back on line.' The current list of businesses that are essential and remain open includes pharmacies, doctors offices, transportation, grocery stores, restaurants for delivery only and liquor stores. 2) How can the business maintain social distancing among employees? The second part of the plan is how safely the business can operate in the climate of COVID-19. 'What is the risk of infection spread of that business. 'Some can say, ""I can open tomorrow in my business, I'll have all sorts of precautions. People will not be less than 6ft apart, there will be no congregation, I won't do conferences or meetings, I can bring them back put them at separated desks... businesses can start to redesign their work place to start to think that way. That's the second factor,' he said. 3) Testing Cuomo said that the blueprint relies on testing - both diagnostic and antibody testing - but that the federal government must step in to make that happen and make it happen quickly because the state does not have the capacity. He has made a direct plea to the federal government for FDA approval for a finger prick test that can then be used for 100,000 tests per day. He did not say whether employees had to have had a test and tested negative for COVID-19 or antibodies before they could return to work.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomohas ordered all residents that they must now wear masks or face coverings in public if they cannot stay 6ft apart as part of his 'blueprint' in reopening the economy which is to determine how essential a business is and then how it an ensure employees stay 6ft apart. Cuomo signed the order regarding masks and face coverings on Wednesday and said people would receive civil violations if they do not comply.It will apply in any public space where social distancing is 'impossible', including in grocery stores, on public transport and on busy streets. It came as the number of new hospitalizations dropped to a record low. The current number of people hospitalized is 18,335 - a decrease of 362 since Monday which is the biggest drop since March 16. There were an additional 11,571 cases of the virus on Tuesday which brings the total across New York to 213,779. Deaths increased by 752 on Tuesday which brings the state's total to 11,586. That number however does not include the some 3,000 that were added to New York City's death toll because officials are now counting people who died without ever testing positive for COVID-19 but who medics fear had the virus. Cuomo did not give a time frame for his reopening plan and he did not give any examples of how he will decide which businesses are more essential than others. It will hinge on the federal government giving funding for diagnostic and antibody tests which he said he would have to happen at the same time as the reopening. The tests will first go to healthcare workers and NYPD officers. 'We have a blueprint for the reopening as guided by testing, tracing but there are two factors; how essential is the business service or product or function, the more essential a business service or product, the more urgent the need to immediately get them back on line. 'Second, what is the risk of infection spread of that business. 'Some can say, ""I can open tomorrow in my business, I'll have all sorts of precautions. People will not be less than 6ft apart, there will be no congregation, I won't do conferences or meetings, I can bring them back put them at separated desks... businesses can start to redesign their work place to start to think that way. 'That's the second factor. 'Thelower risk of infection risk and higher nature of essential services are the businesses you would start prioritizing. 'That's how we will inform our economic reopening, as we're being guided by the testing tracing, and as we're making sure we're not jeopardizing the success we've made in handling the public health issue. Scroll down for video 'That's the whole outline from here until 18 months - building that bridge to the new normal for the economy until we get to a conclusion,' he said. 'It's going to be a phased reopening. The division of responsibility between the federal government and the states will be how the country reopens, Cuomo said, and it relies on each side acting cooperatively to achieve it - something that is hard to imagine after a week of jabs and fears of a constitutional crisis. Trump earlier this week said he had 'total authority' over when states reopened. The comment sparked outrage, uproar and concerns over the president's understanding of the consitution. Since then, he and Cuomo have been locked in a public spat which involved Cuomo calling him schizophrenic, and Trump belittling Cuomo for constantly asking for federal help to solve the pandemic crisis in New York. Cuomo, on Tuesday, freely admitted that he'd asked the federal government for sustained help. On Wednesday, as he laid out his plan, he said that it relied on funding from Trump's government. He is now asking the federal government to give him the funding that would allow production to go from producing 2,000 tests per day - where he hopes it will be next week without federal help - to producing 100,000 per day. When antibody tests become more widely available, they will first go to healthcare workers, cops and fire fighters, he said. In order to put the reopening plan into place, he said the states must decide what they are responsible for and what the federal government will take charge of. 'Wehave to be clear on who does what. The states cannot develop national testing there is no simple answer to it - it's controlled by private sector companies who have been doing it at a reduce volume because that was the world. 'They onlydeveloped the capacity that the market demanded and this is an entirely new market. When you talk to the companies, and I have, they'll say, ""I can'tincrease my volume, I can't get enough swabs or vials or machinery to manufacture it. They also need the chemical agents that are part of the test that aren't manufactured in the US. 'It's very hard to bring this to scale quickly. We need to the federal government to be part of this.Testing now is what ventilators were over the past month. All of a sudden, we needed massive numbers of ventilators. 'Just how do we now do it? The answer on testing is not what happened on ventilators - 50 states competing against each other. We need this partnership to do this. Once you test then you have to trace the contacts. It's a detective, investigator in the public health space. 'That is a massive undertaking,' he said. 'For the states to do this role of reopening, we need funding. The past federal legislation has not provided it. it's that simple,' he said. 'The priority is to make sure you do no harm and keep your eye on the public health issue. 'The single best tool to doing this is large scale testing. Test, trace and isolate,' he said. It remains unclear though if employees will have to first do a test before they can go back to work, or if people will be able to go back to work and stay 6ft apart regardless of whether or not they have ever tested positive for COVID-19. The face mask rule will not come into effect for another three days, giving people enough warning to buy one or find one. There is an enormous shortage of medical masks and of face coverings around the city. Cuomo did not suggest where they should buy them. 'Your right to go out for a walk in the park? Fine. 'Don't infect me. You don't have a right to infect me. If you're going to be in a situation in public where you may come into contact with other people and a situation, that is not socially distanced, you must have a mask or a cloth covering nose and mouth. That is by executive order,' he said. He later clarified that a person should go out with their mask and be prepared to pull it up over their nose and mouth if they come within 6ft of someone, but that they can leave it down, around their chin, if they do not. 'Youwear a mask keep, it below your chin then when you're running, if you see someone, either run across the street or pull it up above your nose and mouth. 'Have itwith you and if you don't see anyone, great. If you're on a walk in the woods and here comes John Campbell, then you have to put your mask up,' he said. He added that it was 'not a big deal' and that companies should see the opportunity in branding or advertising on them. 'When you think about, look, everybody's working so hard to stop the spread of the disease. Wear the mask - whats the big deal?' He is not yet imposing fines but says he has not ruled it out. People will be given a three day compliance period from now in order to get one, he added. He says that the crisis will not be '100 percent' over until a vaccine has been created which will take 12-18 months but that in the meantime, testing and tracing and then a treatment will allow people to get back to some sense of normalcy sooner. Of the 752 new deaths reported by Cuomo,707, were in hospitals and 45 were in nursing homes. The hospitalization rate, ICU admission and intubation rate continues to drop. The current list of essential businesses includes healthcare, transit, grocery stores, pharmacies and restaurants if they only do take-out and delivery.There are other exceptions like news organizations and internet providers. While he can reopen businesses, he is adamant that the federal government is the only agency that can get testing to where it needs to be to ensure a safe recovery from the pandemic. Cuomo said that while the data reflected that New York had managed to flatten the curve of the virus spread, the state was 'not out of the woods' - although the situation had been 'stabilized.' 'The healthcare situation has stabilized. The fears of overwhelming the healthcare systemhas not happened, thanks to the phenomenal work of our front line workers. 'Peopleare still getting infected but we have the spread down to a manageable number,' he said. The difficulty will lie in labs not having the capacity to perform as many tests as are needed. 'To do the testing you need equipment, swabs, vials and all of these things at a capacity that does not now exist. 'Thebottom line is you need large scale testing...we can't do it yet. That is the unvarnished truth. I know because New York has been doing this since it started. 'We have done more tests than any other state near us combined,' he said. New York has tested 500,000 people in a month but it has a population of 19million. 'When you have a state that has a large number you cant do it without fed support,' he said. He is now asking the federal government to give him the funding that would allow production to go from producing 2,000 tests per day - where he hopes it will be next week without federal help - to producing 100,000 per day. When antibody tests become more widely available, they will first go to healthcare workers, cops and fire fighters, he said. In order to put the reopening plan into place, he said the states must decide what they are responsible for and what the federal government will take charge of. 'Wehave to be clear on who does what.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called President Trump's decision to cut off funding to the World Health Organization 'illegal' and said it would be 'swiftly challenged' by Congressional Democrats. Pelosi didn't articulate a plan in the statement she sent to reporters Wednesday, but a senior Democratic aide told DailyMail.com Democrats could pursue a ruling from the Government Accountability Office. 'We are reviewing all of our options, including asking GAO for an opinion given their opinion that the president's hold on Ukraine funding was illegal,' the aide said. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in December over a scheme to hold up more than $400 million in Congressionally-approved military aid to Ukraine while pressuring the country's president to announce that he was investigating Joe and Hunter Biden. Joe Biden, then a candidate for president, is now the presumptive Democratic nominee. In January, before Trump was acquitted by the Senate, the GAO came out with a report that said the administration had broken the law when freezing the aid. 'Faithful execution of the law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,' the GAO report said. '[The Office of Management and Budget] withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act.' 'Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA,' the GAO report said. The Impoundment Control Act is a Watergate-era law that was passed by Congress after President Richard Nixon withheld funds for programs he opposed.Lawmakers of that era believed he was abusing his power. On Tuesday, Trump announced that he would be halting funding to the WHO over the agency's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The president said WHO was too 'China-centric' and suggested the health organization helped China cover up the early spread of the virus. He also objected to WHO's decision not to come out in support of a travel ban from China. 'The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures,' Trump said in the Rose Garden Tuesday, crediting himself for saving countless lives for instituting one into the United States. The WHO generally doesn't support travel bans because of the economic disruptions they cause and concerns that countries might be motivated to under-report growing disease threats. 'The president's halting of funding to the WHO as it leads the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic is senseless,' Pelosi said Wednesday.'We can only be successful in defeating this global pandemic through a coordinated international response with respect for science and data.' 'But sadly, as he has since Day One, the president is ignoring global health experts, disregarding science and undermining the heroes fighting on the frontline, at great risk to the lives and livelihoods of Americans and people around the world,' Pelosi's statement continued. She then repeated a complaint she made when first hearing about the president's decision to halt WHO's funding. 'This is another case, as I have said, of the president's ineffective response, that ""a weak person, a poor leader, takes no responsibility. A weak person blames others,""' she said, quoting herself. 'This decision is dangerous, illegal and will be swiftly challenged.'"
"New York state has only received about $12,000 in federal funding for each of its coronavirus cases compared to the $300,000 per case that Nebraska received, according to Gov Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo is pushing for more funding after taking issue with the amount his hard-hit state received from the$2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package in comparison to states, like Nebraska, that have much fewer cases. As of Tuesday, more than 200,000 people in epicenter New York had tested positive for coronavirus and more than 10,000 had died. Nebraska, however, had recorded a total of 900 infections and 20 deaths. 'Some states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported COVID-19 case,' Cuomo tweeted. 'New York is the hardest-hit state and yet we are getting only about $12,000 per case. We need a fair federal stimulus bill that is distributed by need.' The funding is part of the immediate $30 billion being distributed to hospitals and healthcare facilities as part of the stimulus package. The amount is being calculated based on previous Medicare revenues. Cuomo and other lawmakers have argued that the funds should instead be handed out based on the number of cases each state has - meaning New York and New Jersey would get the biggest portion. The $12,000 figure Cuomo quoted came from estimates in a Kaiser Health report last week that broke down how much the states would receive from the $30 billion per coronavirus case. New York was estimated to receive $12,000 and $18,000 for New Jersey. Meanwhile, Nebraska was estimated to receive $379,000, while West Virginia was to receive$471,000 and $380,000 for Minnesota.  It comes as Cuomo and Republican Maryland GovernorLarry Hoganissued a bipartisan call at the weekend for an additional $500 billion in federal aid for states and territories dealing with the coronavirus. Hogan is the chair and Cuomo is the vice chair of theNational Governors Association. The two said in a statement that implementing stay-at-home orders and other public health measures due to the coronavirus have 'resulted in catastrophic damage to state economies'. 'In the absence of unrestricted fiscal support of at least $500 billion from the federal government, states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to critically important services all across this country, hampering public health, the economic recovery, and-in turn-our collective effort to get people back to work,' they said. The governors also said the recently passed federal CARES Act should be amended to allow existing federal funding to be used not only for COVID-19-related expenses but also to offset lost revenue. The statement comes as the Trump administration and congressional leaders appear poised to launch new bipartisan talks on a fresh coronavirus aid package with hopes for action as soon as next week. Meanwhile, government relief checks began arriving in bank accounts on Wednesday as the economic damage to the US from the coronavirus piled up. The world's biggest economy began issuing one-time payments this week to tens of millions of people as part of its $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package, with adults receiving up to $1,200 each and $500 per child to help them pay the rent or cover other bills. The checks will be directly deposited into bank accounts or mailed to households, depending on how they filed their tax returns. As of last week, some 17 million people in the US had been thrown onto the unemployment rolls because of the crisis."
"An upscale outlet mall near Omaha, Nebraska, is planning to reopen in just nine days despite a statewide order prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continues to grow. Nebraska Crossing Outlets announced that it is aiming for a 'soft reopening' on April 24, which would be roughly the same time officials expect the number of coronavirus cases in the state to peak. Health experts and others have condemned the plan as reckless because it could draw large crowds into confided spaces where they are at high risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19. But owner Rod Yates claims that the reopening will serve an important purpose as a case study for other malls preparing to go back in business after the worst of the COVID-19 crisis passes. 'We're looking at the great opportunity to set some best practices and help our retailers open their portfolios across the country,' owner Rod Yates told the Omaha World-Herald. Nebraska is one of the few states that still allows malls to be open even though many businesses are closed because the state prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people and limits restaurants and bars to take out and delivery services. It is not immediately clear how many stores will reopen when the mall does and how the facility will comply with state-ordered social distancing protocols. The outlet sits next to a heavily traveled stretch of Interstate 80 about halfway between Omaha and Lincoln. Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster counties, which include Omaha and Lincoln and their suburbs, had seen a total of 354 cases as of Wednesday afternoon. That's about 40 percent of the statewide total of 901 cases of COVID-19 and 20 deaths linked to the disease. Douglas County Health Director Dr Adi Pour called the reopening plan 'disappointing'. 'If we open things up too soon, we're going to see outbreaks,' Pour said during the county's monthly COVID-19 meeting on Wednesday. 'That's not what you want to see. There are businesses in town that have been very unresponsive to recommendations.'  Gov Pete Ricketts said Tuesday the stores are free to reopen as long as they follow the state's social-distancing guidelines. 'We didn't ask them to close, and we didn't ask them to open,' he said at his weekday coronavirus news conference. Ricketts, a Republican, has encouraged residents to shop alone and limit their excursions to one trip per week, but he hasn't ordered any formal restrictions. He said he discussed the matter with the shopping center's managers, and told them that if they chose to open, they needed to follow the state rules. Mall officials say they have purchased 100 thermometers for each store to use to check employees at the start of each day, and they plan to install 200 plastic shields at registers to separate customers and employees. Officials plan to encourage employees and customers to wear masks and gloves and avoid walking around in groups at the outdoor mall. 'Anything we do is going to be very controlled,' Yates said. 'We're not going to do any mass events that attract hundreds of people. We're going to slowly ease ourselves into the process of getting ourselves open.' It could be difficult for stores to maintain social distancing if crowds of shoppers returned, but Craig Johnson, president of consumer consultancy Customer Growth Partners, said he doesn't think the mall is likely to have that problem. 'My guess is they will be happy and delighted if a store gets crowded enough where people have to worry about their six-foot radius,' Johnson said. 'I just don't think they're going to get a big crowd.' Retail analyst Jon Reily also said he didn't think the reopening will be successful because consumers will likely be reluctant to shop there. 'People are very cautious,' Reily, senior vice president of global commerce strategy at Isobar, told AP. 'I don't know if old patterns of going to the mall to buy nonessential items are really going to stick.' But Yates said he's expecting plenty of people to turn out at the mall when it reopens. 'My phone has been ringing off the hook with customers asking us: ""When can we get the stores open, we have some shopping needs, we want to get out of the house, we want to do something different,""' he said. Two general managers at Nebraska Crossing stores told The World-Herald that they worried about the potential ramifications of reopening too soon. 'There's been absolutely no regard to Nebraska Crossing employees. None of us signed up to be guinea pigs,' one manager said. 'We all have family. I'm not willing to bring that to my family. I’m not willing to be a test subject for you guys, and neither are my employees.' 'We haven't even hit our peak in Nebraska yet. That's ridiculous. I understand it's going to be a long time, but there has to be a protocol set in place that needs to be tested before we open to the public.' The other general manager expressed concern about out-of-state visitors from harder-hit areas, which the mall is known to attract. Ricketts addressed that concern by asking people who come to Nebraska from other states to self-quarantine for 14 days. 'I gotta tell you, I just don't think you’re going to see a lot of traveling this time when everybody knows we’re supposed to stay at home,' the governor said."
"A government watchdog agency has ruled that the Pentagon's cloud contract award to Microsoft was legal, despite claims from Amazon that it was snubbed because of President Donald Trump's dislike for Jeff Bezos. The Defense Department inspector general found no evidence of White House interference in the highly lucrative cloud computing contract award process, ruling Wednesday it was in line with legal and government purchasing standards. However the report said investigators could not fully review the matter because the White House would not allow unfettered access to witnesses. The investigation began when the Pentagon's contract, potentially worth $10 billion, was awarded to Microsoft last October. Amazon Web Services, a market leader in providing cloud computing services, had long been considered a leading candidate to run the Pentagon's Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, known as JEDI. The project will store and process vast amounts of classified data, allowing the US military to improve communications with soldiers on the battlefield and use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities. Amazon alleged that the bidding was improperly influenced by President Donald Trump's dislike of Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos. Bezos owns The Washington Post, a news outlet often criticized by Trump. Amazon filed a lawsuit and work on the project was halted. Back in March, the judge presiding over the bid protest in the US Court of Federal Claims said Amazon's challenge likely had merit on some technical grounds involving pricing. The review released Wednesday by the Defense Department's inspector general did not draw a conclusion about whether Microsoft was appropriately declared the winner. Rather, it looked at whether the decision-making process was proper and legal. It also examined allegations of unethical behavior by Pentagon officials involved in the matter and generally determined that any ethical lapses did not influence the outcome. The review also sought to determine whether the White House influenced the Pentagon's decision, as Amazon has alleged. The report said that although it appears there was no such White House pressure, the reviewers could not definitely determine the full extent of White House interactions with the Pentagon's decision makers. 'We could not review this matter fully because of the assertion of a ""presidential communications privilege,"" which resulted in several DOD witnesses being instructed by the DOD Office of General Counsel not to answer our questions about potential communications between White House and DOD officials about JEDI,' the report said. 'As a result, we could not be certain whether there were any White House communications with some DOD officials which may have affected the JEDI procurement. 'However, we believe the evidence we received showed that the DOD personnel who evaluated the contract proposals and awarded Microsoft the JEDI cloud contract were not pressured... by any DOD leaders more senior to them, who may have communicated with the White House,' the report said. The Project on Government Oversight, a private watchdog group, said it was alarmed by the White House's use of presidential privilege to limit the inspector general's access to witness information. 'Executive privilege is designed to protect national security and the president´s candid conversations with close advisers, not to block agency officials from discussing a large government contract that does not call for direct presidential decision-making,' the group's top lawyer Scott Amey said in a statement. A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Robert Carver, said the inspector general's report shows that the contract award process was fair and legal. 'This report should finally close the door on the media and corporate-driven attacks on the career procurement officials who have been working tirelessly to get the much needed JEDI cloud computing environment into the hands of our frontline warfighters while continuing to protect American taxpayers,' Carver said."
"Former President Barack Obama reportedly played a significant role in convincing Bernie Sanders to bow out of the Democratic primary, paving the way for his former Vice President Joe Biden to seal the nomination uncontested. Though Obama has politically distanced himself publicly from Biden since he announced his White House bid last year, over the last few weeks he's reportedly been working quietly to help 'accelerate the endgame' for his former sidekick, the New York Timesreported. Since Biden cemented his place as the presumptive nominee with a series of resounding Super Tuesdays victories, Obama reportedly had at least four conversations with Sanders - Biden's last remaining competitor - trying to convince him to step aside. According to sources close to the Democratic Socialist, Obama's efforts had a considerable impact on Sanders' eventual decision to end his bid last week. He allegedly reassured Sanders he'd already accomplished what he'd set out to do: by pushing the Democratic party substantially to the left. Obama motivations were reportedly simple: he wanted to avoid a repeat of the protracted 2016 primary, in which many - including Hillary Clinton - accused Sanders of staying in the racelong after his conceivable path to victory had closed. 'He hurt me, there's no doubt about it,' Clinton told Howard Stern late last year. 'And I hope he doesn't do it again to whoever gets the nomination. Once is enough.' But Sanders wasn't the only 2020 Democratic hopeful who shared numerous interactions with Obama during the primary trail. Despite his relative public silence, the former president held regular conversations with each of the candidates - both during their bids and after they concluded. '[Obama’s] private counsel consistently emphasized staying focused on the ultimate goal: winning the White House in November,' a source close to Obama told CNN. It's said that Obama 'urged [candidates] to keep in mind that we must be well-positioned to unify as a party once we have a nominee.' The Vermont senator clearly heeded Obama's advice once more, endorsing Biden on Monday night during a livestream broadcast alongside his former rival, as he and Biden preached the importance of coming together to defeat Trump in November. 'Today I am asking all Americans, I'm asking every Democrat, I'm asking every independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans , to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,' Sanders said to Biden on the split-screen, as both men were broadcasting from their homes. 'To make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe, and I'm speaking just for myself now, is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country,' Sanders went on. In a bid to sway the progressive vote in his favor, Biden assured Bernie's loyal following that the veteran senator would help to advise him on a number of key issues, from the economy to health care. Barack Obama's long-anticipated public endorsement of Biden followed on Tuesday afternoon in the form of a 12-minute monologue. Obama said Biden possessed the right kind of leadership, 'the kind of leadership guided by knowledge and experience, honesty and humility, empathy and grace. 'That kind of leadership doesn't just belong in our state capitals and mayors offices, it belongs in the White House,' Obama continued. 'And that's why I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States.' The former president also did his part to unify the Democratic Party, giving Bernie Sanders an honorable mention by saying he is an 'American original' and said his ideas will be crucial moving forward. 'Because for the second time in 12 years, we'll have the incredible task of rebuilding our economy,' Obama said. 'And to meet the moment, the Democratic Party will have to be bold.' Obama said that what Biden and Sanders have in common is that they agree that change needs to occur. 'And that only happens if we win this election,' Obama warned. 'Because one thing everybody has learned right now is the Republicans occupying the White House and running the U.S. Senate are not interested in progress, they're interested in power.' In the meantime, Obama and Biden are said to be working together to best determine how, when and where they will deploy the former president to best help Biden's 2020 ticket. The Biden campaign is said to be eager to utilize Obama as quickly as they can, particularly where fundraisers are concerned, as they attempt to do battle with President Trump's multitudinous supply line of small-dollar donations."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday'inequality is a pre-existing condition' as the coronavirus continues to ravage African American communities. The Democrat, appearing on The View, told the panel it's 'no surprise' the vulnerable are being worst hit by the pandemic. Early data from U.S. states shows African Americans are more likely to die from COVID-19, highlighting longstanding disparities in health and inequalities in access to medical care, experts said. AOC added: 'Ultimately, it's inequality that's the preexisting condition. You can't just go to someone and tell them, ""Hey. You should have had health care this whole time when you're working an hourly job and your employer doesn't give it to you"".' Ocasio-Cortezsaid: 'When a pandemic like this hits or even any natural disaster like a hurricane, like what we saw in hurricane Katrina or hurricane Maria, they don't happen in a vacuum, they happen when communities are disproportionately located on the front line. 'Here in New York City, about 55 per cent of our front line workers, including grocery store workers, delivery workers and more, are black and brown.' 'It's tragic, but it is also no surprise that it's impacting the vulnerable the most.' Donald Trump and the government's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, acknowledged the higher death rate among African Americans during a White House briefing earlier this month. The president called it a 'tremendous challenge'. AOC last week said she wantsblack and brown communities to get coronavirus reparations, because a history of inequality has left them at higher risk of suffering from the deadly virus. ANew York City map using data as of April 7 showed that there are higher numbers of cases of coronavirus in poorer New York neighborhoods than in wealthier zip codes. On Wednesday, discussing Joe Biden's presidential campaign, AOC added: 'My community especially has been so impacted, and it's, you know, for a lot of communities, this is an issue of life and death. 'We have had kids in cages. We have had a pandemic response that happened way too late that has cost us lives. We have people that don't have access to critical care that they need. I think it's really important that we rally behind our Democratic nominee in November.' AOC's district, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens, has been among the hardest hit by coronavirus in New York City. She told The View: 'Everyone wants to fight against these policies until they have been personally impacted. 'I think that vulnerability, that personal vulnerability, really brings a lot of people around, and what we're seeing right now is that guaranteeing health care in this country is not about giving charity to people. It affects all of us.' A history of systemic racism and inequity in access to health care and economic opportunity has made many African Americans far more vulnerable to the virus. Black adults suffer from higher rates of obesity, diabetes and asthma, which make them more susceptible, and also are more likely to be uninsured. They also often report that medical professionals take their ailments less seriously when they seek treatment. They are also overrepresented among workers like nurse aides, grocery store clerks, emergency dispatchers and public transportation employees who cannot telecommute. That forces them out into the general public at a time when others are under strict stay-at-home orders. Dr. Summer Johnson McGee, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of New Haven,said she was not surprised the U.S. black population is experiencing a worse outcome during the pandemic. Racism has led to a lack of investment in African American communities and worse health care for the population in general, McGee said. "
"Bill Gates slammed President Donald Trump’s decision to withhold $500million in funding to the World Health Organization, saying it's 'as dangerous as it sounds'. The tech magnate, worth $104billion, tweeted Wednesday saying the US' involvement with the WHO is more necessary than ever. 'Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds,' he tweeted Wednesday. 'Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever,' he added. On Tuesday night Trump announced he would halt funding to the WHO immediately for 'its role in severely mismanaging the spread of coronavirus' and would launch an investigation into their mishandling of the pandemic. The US Chamber of Commerce and the American Medical Association lead the outrage against Trump's controversial move, saying it wasn't in the best interest of the country and urged him to reconsider. In a press briefing on Wednesday in response to Trump's decision,WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 'We regret the decision of the President of the United States to order a halt in funding to the WHO.' He praised the US as a 'longstanding and generous friend' of the WHO and noted that the organization isn't just fighting COVID-19, it's working to fight a slew of other illnesses including malaria, cancer, and HIV across the globe. He noted the WHO will review how the withdrawal of funding would impact its projects and 'will work with ourpartners to fill any financial gaps we face to ensure our work continues uninterrupted.' Trump claims the group failed to investigate early signs of the virus' ability to spread from one human to another and failed to call out China for its lack of transparency over the virus. The United States funds $400 million to $500 million to the WHO each year - roughly 15 percent of the organization's entire budget. The WHO first declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern in late January. One week later the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledged up to $100million to help contain the pandemic and help find a vaccine for the virus and limit its spread. Of that pledge, $20million went to groups including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the next biggest donor to the WHO after the US and accounts for close to 10 percent of the United Nations agency’s funding. Today there are over 615,000 cases of the virus in the US and over 26,000 deaths. Gates has been outspoken throughout the outbreak. In March he urged the public to practice social distancing and pleaded for Trump to implement a country-wide shutdown as he predicted that COVID-19 cases would peak in late April. In a TED interview last month Gates didn’t mention Trump by name but expressed dismay over his leadership as the president pushed to reopen the country. 'There really is no middle ground, and it’s very tough to say to people: ""Hey, keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner. We want you to keep spending because there’s maybe a politician who thinks GDP growth is all that counts,""' the tech giant said. 'It’s very irresponsible for somebody to suggest that we can have the best of both worlds,' he added. Trump’s shocking decision to halt WHO funding comes after he repeated butted heads with the international organization's leadership. 'Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,' Trump said. WHO Director-General Tedros warned Trump last week to not to 'politicize' the virus. 'If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicizing it. My short message is: Please quarantine politicizing Covid. The unity of your country will be very important to defeat this dangerous virus,' he said last week. Trump said the US pays the WHO significantly more in funds than its counterpart China does, which pays about $40million a year. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi lambasted Trump’s decision saying: 'This is another case, as I have said, of the President’s ineffective response, that a weak person, a poor leader, takes no responsibility. A weak person blames others.' Following Trump's Tuesday announcement to cut $500million in funding to the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association has condemned his administration for the action. 'During the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating Covid-19 easier,' president Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement Tuesday. She said 'clear and consistent messaging' is key for all parties during a health crisis. 'The public needs to trust that their leaders are being honest and forthcoming and are really working cooperatively to do whatever they can. 'Physicians feel like we're going into this with one arm tied behind our back. And so we really need the administration to use all the levers of the government to get those on the front lines all the support they need,' she added. The US Chamber of Congress also pushed back again the funds cut on Wednesday. 'The Chamber supports a reformed but functional World Health Organization, and US leadership and involvement are essential to ensuring its transparency and accountability going forward,' Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's executive vice president and head of international affairs, said in a statement. 'However, cutting the WHO’s funding during the COVID-19 pandemic is not in US interests given the organization’s critical role assisting other countries — particularly in the developing world — in their response,' he added. The American Medical Association has also branded the president as 'dangerous' for his move to cut ties with the WHO. 'During the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating Covid-19 easier,'president Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement Tuesday. 'Physicians feel like we're going into this with one arm tied behind our back. And so we really need the administration to use all the levers of the government to get those on the front lines all the support they need,' she added. UN Secretary General António Guterres, also condemned the Trump administration saying now is 'not the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organization in the fight against the virus.' The US Chamber of Congress also pushed back again the funds cut on Wednesday. 'The Chamber supports a reformed but functional World Health Organization, and US leadership and involvement are essential to ensuring its transparency and accountability going forward,' Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's executive vice president and head of international affairs, said in a statement. 'However, cutting the WHO’s funding during the COVID-19 pandemic is not in US interests given the organization’s critical role assisting other countries — particularly in the developing world — in their response.' The editor in chief of The Lancet, an international medical journal, joined the chorus, slamming the end of funding as 'a crime against humanity'. 'Every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity,'Richard Horton tweeted. Tedros told the press conference in Geneva today: 'WHO is getting on with the job. We are continuing to study this virus every moment of every day. We're learning from many countries about what works and we're sharing that information with the world.' 'Every day we bring together thousands of clinicians, epidemiologists, educators, researchers, lab technicians, infection prevention specialists and others to exchange knowledge on Covid-19. 'Our technical guidance brings together the most up-to-date evidence for health ministers, health workers and individuals. 'We will continue to work with every country and every partner to serve the people of the world with a relentless commitment to science, solutions and solidarity. 'Since the beginning, WHO has been fighting the pandemic with every ounce of our soul and spirit. We will continue to do that until the end.' WHO Health Emergencies Program Executive Director Dr Michael J Ryan defied Trump and said that the WHO was clear from the start in saying there was a risk of human transmission of COVID-19. 'In the first weeks of January the WHO was very, very clear. We alerted the world on January the 5, systems around the world including the US began to activate their incident management systems on January 6... The virus was identified on January 7 and the sequence was shared on January the 12 with the world,' he said. 'There is always a risk with a respiratory pathogen that it can move from person to person... When WHO issued its first guidance to countries it was extremely clear that respiratory precautions should be taken in dealing with patents with this disease, that labs needed to be careful in terms of their precautions in taking samples, because there was a risk that the disease could spread from person to person in those environments.' Following Trump's decision, China has warned it has 'serious concerns'. Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for Beijing's foreign ministry, said the global battle against the pandemic is at a 'critical moment' and that suspending funding will 'undermine international cooperation against the epidemic.' Yesterday Trump praised his own decision to limit travel to and from China on January 31 - a month after the first cases of the disease were reported. 'Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world,' he said. 'The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures.'  Trump has suggested the WHO had been doing the bidding of China, where the coronavirus outbreak began before spreading to the United States. The US is the largest single contributor to the WHO, paying in some $893million between 2018 and 2019. By comparison the UK - the third-largest contributor to the WHO overall and the second largest among nation states - paid in some $435million between 2018 and 2019. On Tuesday, Downing Street said it has no intention of following Trump's example and withholding funds to the WHO, saying it 'has an important role to play in leading the global health response.' 'Coronavirus is a global challenge and it's essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat,' Boris Johnson's official spokesman added. On WednesdayDr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Trump's funding cut: 'CDC and WHO has had a long history of working together in multiple outbreaks throughout the world, as we continue to do in this one. And so, we've had a very productive public health relationship. We continue to have that.' When asked by GMA host George Stephanopoulos if the WHO failed in its handling of the pandemic, he said: 'I'd like to do the postmortem on this outbreak once we get through it together.' How the man running World Health Organisation trashed by Trump as China-centric is a career politician who worked for a Communist junta and became WHO's first NON-doctor Director-General 'following intense lobbying from Beijing' Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a little-known figure before the coronavirus pandemic, has since risen to prominence as Director-General of the World Health Organisation which is leading global responses to the virus. Dr Tedros - who has never practiced as a medical doctor - is a career politician who was born in what is now Eritrea, began work under the Communist Derg junta, studied in the UK, then rose to the top of Ethiopia's government first as Health Minister and then Foreign Minister before being elected to lead the WHO in 2017. He is now facing heavy criticism over his handling of the pandemic, especially for praise he heaped on China's communist party for its response - hailing the regime's 'commitment to transparency' and saying the speed with which it detected the virus was 'beyond words'. That has led to allegations - loudly made by Donald Trump - that the WHO is 'China-centric', a position that the US President has promised to 'look into'. Trump has now suspended US funding to the WHO until an investigation has been carried out, while suggesting that they withheld information on the virus. Indeed, it is not the first time that Dr Tedros has been accused of cozying up to China. Shortly after his election victory in 2017, it was alleged that Chinese diplomats had been heavily involved in lobbying for him. UN records also show that Chinese contributions to both Ethiopia's aid budget and the WHO have substantially increased during times when he was in top leadership positions. Shortly after his election to the WHO, a report in The Times said: 'Chinese diplomats had campaigned hard for the Ethiopian, using Beijing's financial clout and opaque aid budget to build support for him among developing countries.' DrTedros - who is married and has five children - was born in 1965 in Asmara, which was part of Ethiopia at the time but is now in Eritrea. As a child he saw his younger brother die to an infection, which he believes was measles, which he later said spurred his determination to work on health and health policy. He graduated from university in Ethiopia in 1986 with a degree in biology and went to work as a health official in the regime of Marxist dictatorMengistu Haile Mariam, while the country was ruled by the Derg military junta. According to the BBC, Dr Tedros then joined the hard-left TPLF - which started life as a Communist party and played a major role in overthrowing Mariam in 1991. It later became part of theEPRDF, a coalition of left-wing parties that ruled Ethiopia until last year. Around the same time as Mariam's ouster, Dr Tedros left Ethiopia and went to the UK where he studied at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, graduating with Masters of Science in Immunology of Infectious Diseases in 1992. He then went on to study at the University of Nottingham, where he received a PhD in community health in 2000. After this, he returned to Ethiopia where he joined the health ministry and rose through the ranks from regional health minister all the way to national Minister for Heath - a position he took up in 2005. During his tenure, which lasted until 2012, he was widely praised for opening thousands of health centres, employing tens of thousands of medics, bringing down rates of HIV/AIDS, measles and malaria, as well as bringing information technology and the internet into the heath system. In November 2012 he was promoted to Foreign Minister, and was widely hailed for helping to negotiate a boost in UN funding for Ethiopia, including as part of theAddis Ababa Action Agenda. Indeed, UN funding records show that around this time the country received millions in additional funding - including from China, which had previously given little or nothing to support the country. In 2015 and 2016 China gave some $16million to Ethiopia in spending commitments and cash contributions, largely in support of food or refugee programs. In 2011, just before Dr Tedros took up the role, and in 2017, just after he left, China handed over another $44million in commitments and contributions. Its total contributions outside of this period, dating back to the year 2000, were just $345,000. In 2017, Dr Tedros left the Ethiopian government and entered the running for Director-General of the WHO as the tenure of Dr Margaret Chan, a Canadian-Chinese physician, was coming to an end. The election was the first to take place under a system of polling all UN member states as part of a secret ballot. Previously, leaders were chosen by a closed-door vote of an executive committee. Eventually the field was boiled down to two candidates - Dr Tedros and Briton Dr David Nabarro, a life-long physician who had helped lead UN responses to previous outbreaks including bird flu, the cholera outbreak in Haiti, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Dr Tedros won the ballot by a reported 133 votes to 50, becoming the first African leader of the WHO and the first non-medic to hold the role. His victory came in part thanks to 50 out of 54 African states voting for him. However, he quickly mired himself in controversy by recommending African dictator Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador, amid allegations he was trying to repay favors granted during the election. There were reports that the move was also intended to reward China, a long-time supporter of Mugabe, for using its influence to have him elected. The Timesadded: 'China has praised the authoritarian development model of Ethiopia's regime, which rules under emergency powers and has put down pro-democracy protests.' During the 2017 election itself, several groups within Ethiopia opposed Dr Tedros's appointment due to his links with theTPLF and allegations that they stifled journalists and repressed minorities. Dr Tedros was also accused of covering up three separate cholera outbreaks in 2006, 2008 and 2011 by mis-reporting it as 'watery diarrhea', allegations he dismissed as a 'smear campaign' by his British rival. Following his election to the WHO, Dr Tedros vowed to reform the organization by placing an emphasis on universal healthcare at its center while also increasing funding. Further UN funding records show that, during his tenure, assessed contributions to the WHO by China have also risen significantly - from roughly $23million in 2016 to $38million in 2019. China has also committed to a further $57million in funding in 2020, though has yet to pay the balance. Meanwhile funding from other major world economies - including the US, Russia, Japan and Germany - has remained largely flat or even fallen over the same period. Assessed contributions make up only around a quarter of the WHO's budget, the rest of which comes from donations. December 31 – China first reports a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan to the WHO January 4 – WHO tweets about ‘a cluster of pneumonia cases’ in Wuhan with no deaths, saying investigations into the cause are underway January 5 – The WHO issues its first guidance on ‘pneumonia of unknown cause’, saying there are a total of 44 patients and 11 in severe condition.

"The head of the World Health Organization said today he 'regrets' Donald Trump's decision to suspend US funding for the agency and called for 'solidarity' in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The WHO's embattled chiefTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference that 'this is a time for all of us to be united in our common struggle' as he defended the agency's handling of the crisis. Tedros said the WHO is 'fighting the pandemic with every ounce of our soul and spirit' and will 'continue to do that until the end' - but said its management of the disease would be reviewed by member states 'in due course'. 'We will continue to work with every country and every partner to serve the people of the world with a relentless commitment to science, solutions and solidarity,' he said. Trump has suspended $500million in US funding for the WHO after claiming it had 'accelerated' the deadly contagion by advising against travel bans in the early days of the epidemic. Speaking at the White House yesterday, Trump accused the WHO of resisting travel bans out of 'political correctness' as he boasted of his own decision to cut off travel from China on January 31. The President's decision has been met with anger from a series of governments today, including China which voiced 'serious concerns' and Germany which defended the WHO's 'unbelievably important work'. Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for Beijing's foreign ministry, said the global battle against the pandemic is at a 'critical moment' and that suspending funding will 'undermine international cooperation against the epidemic.' Tedros says the WHO is reviewing the impact of the funding cut but vowed to 'ensure our work continues uninterrupted'. Tedros told the press conference in Geneva today: 'The United States of America has been a longstanding and generous friend to WHO, and we hope it will continue to be so. 'We regret the decision of the President of the United States to order a halt in funding to the World Health Organisation.' He added: 'With support from the people and government of the United States, WHO works to improve the health of many of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. 'WHO is not only fighting Covid-19. We're also working to address polio, measles, malaria, Ebola, HIV, tuberculosis, malnutrition, cancer, diabetes, mental health and many other diseases and conditions.' Mounting an impassioned defence of the WHO's response, he said: 'WHO is getting on with the job. We are continuing to study this virus every moment of every day. We're learning from many countries about what works and we're sharing that information with the world. 'Every day we bring together thousands of clinicians, epidemiologists, educators, researchers, lab technicians, infection prevention specialists and others to exchange knowledge on Covid-19. 'Our technical guidance brings together the most up-to-date evidence for health ministers, health workers and individuals. ‘We will continue to work with every country and every partner to serve the people of the world with a relentless commitment to science, solutions and solidarity. 'Since the beginning, WHO has been fighting the pandemic with every ounce of our soul and spirit. We will continue to do that until the end.' Tedros continued: 'Covid-19 does not discriminate between rich nations and poor, large nations and small. It does not discriminate between nationalities, ethnicities or ideologies. Neither do we. 'This is a time for all of us to be united in our common struggle against a common threat, a dangerous enemy. When we're divided, the virus exploits the cracks between us. We're committed to serving the world's people and to accountability for the resources with which we're entrusted. 'In due course, WHO's performance in tackling this pandemic will be reviewed by WHO's member states and the independent bodies that are in place to ensure transpancency and accountability. This is part of the usual process put in place by our member states. No doubt areas for improvement will be identified and there will be lessons for all of us to learn. 'But for now our focus, my focus, is on stopping this virus and saving lives. WHO is grateful to the many nations, organisations and individuals who have expressed their support and commitment to WHO in recent days including their financial commitment. 'We welcome this demonstration of global solidarity because solidarity is the rule of the game to defeat Covid-19.' Trump had earlier singled out what he called the WHO's 'dangerous and costly decision' to argue against international travel bans to combat the pandemic. While praising his own decision to limit travel to and from China on January 31 - a month after the first cases of the disease were reported - Trump added: 'Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world. 'The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures.' The US is the largest single contributor to the WHO, paying in some $893million between 2018 and 2019 which made up around 15 per cent of the agency's total budget during that period. By comparison the UK - the third-largest contributor to the WHO overall and the second largest among nation states - paid in some $435million between 2018 and 2019. On Tuesday, Downing Street said it has no intention of following Trump's example and withholding funds to the WHO, saying it 'has an important role to play in leading the global health response.' 'Coronavirus is a global challenge and it's essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat,' Boris Johnson's official spokesman added. Germany took a similar line, saying the WHO was doing 'unbelievably important work' and that 'blaming others won't help'. Announcing the move to suspend funding Tuesday, Trump suggested the WHO had been doing the bidding of China, where the coronavirus outbreak began before spreading to the United States. Trump pointed to the funding disparities between China and the US, which both fund the WHO. The president said while American taxpayers pay around $400 to $500 million annually to the WHO, China pays a 10th of that, at around $40 million a year. Yet since last week Trump has blasted the WHO for being too China-centric, a point he continued to make Tuesday. 'The WHO pushed China's misinformation about the virus saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bans,' Trump said. He said other countries who followed WHO's advice experienced 'great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days.'

At the briefing, CNN'sKaitlan Collins brought up how Trump is punishing the WHO for praising China's transparency when he, too, praised China's transparency. Several days before Trump decided to announce the partial travel ban, he praised China's effort on Twitter. 'China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,' Trump wrote on January 24.'It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!' Trump sporadically praised China through February and March as well - while also occasionally calling coronavirus the 'China virus.' On Tuesday when asked if he was being hypocritical, Trump answered, 'I'm always respectful of China,' before bringing up the amount of money he believed he brought in because of the trade war, brushing off the question. Last week Trump teased that he might halt funds, but then walked back that threat when a reporter asked if that would be a smart move mid-global pandemic. 'I'm not saying I'm going to do it, but I'm going to look at it,' Trump said then. But on Tuesday, he leaned in. 'For the time we will redirect global health and directly work with others. All of the aid that we send will be discussed ... with very powerful and influential and smart groups, medically, politically and every other way,' Trump said. 'And we'll be discussing it with other countries and global health partners what we do with all that money that goes to WHO.' 'And maybe WHO will reform and maybe they won't,' Trump said. The WHO generally doesn't support travel bans because it could lead countries to under-report cases of disease anddestabilize economies, while a country is trying to fight an epidemic. 'Although travel restrictions may intuitively seem like the right thing to do, this is not something that WHO usually recommends,' saidTarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson, when discussing the China travel banin late January, when Trump put the U.S. ban in place. 'This is because of the social disruption they cause and the intensive use of resources required,'Jašarević said. Trump didn't say that he necessarily thought WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus should be replaced, as several Republican Senate allies of the president have called for. 'We're doing an investigation,' the president answered to a question about a Tedros ouster. 'I don't know the gentleman, but I know there's been problems.' Democrats slammed Trump for the move, saying this was not the time to stop cash for health. Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee said: 'Not wanting to take responsibility as the deaths continue to mount, he blames others.' And Trump enemy Adam Schiff said: 'International cooperation on public health has never been more critical. Freezing funding for the WHO will only make it worse.' John Sawers, former British permanent representative to the UN who went on to lead MI6, told BBC Radio 4that while the WHO had 'serious questions to answer' around the pandemic, it was not ultimately to blame. 'I think it would be better to hold China responsible for those issues rather than the WHO,' he said. 'That doesn't excuse the head of the WHO for failing to stand up for the facts and the data and making the right demands of the Chinese... but actually the anger should be directed at China rather than the UN agencies.' António Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN which oversees the WHO, was also deeply critical of the decision - saying that 'now is not the time' to cut funding to a global health body. 'It is not the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organization in the fight against the virus,' he said. 'As I have said before, now is the time for unity and for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences.' Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has been at the forefront of efforts to predict and prevent a global pandemic with the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, was also heavily critical of Trump's decision. He tweeted: 'Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. 'Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs WHOnow more than ever.' Lawrence Gostin, an American law professor specialising in public health who also works for the WHO, said Trump had 'gone too far' in withholding funds and said it puts the US at risk of repeated waves of coronavirus infections. 'I was shocked that he actually went through with it, it's deeply concerning and dismaying,' he told BBC Radio 4, predicting it will have a 'devastating impact globally, and I think it will come back to bite the United States itself.' He said the virus is about to start spreading through sub-Saharan Africa and will come back to reinfect the US in a second, third or even fourth wave unless it is tackled on a global scale. 'We are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain,' he said. How the man running World Health Organisation trashed by Trump as China-centric is a career politician who worked for a Communist junta and became WHO's first NON-doctor Director-General 'following intense lobbying from Beijing' Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a little-known figure before the coronavirus pandemic, has since risen to prominence as Director-General of the World Health Organisation which is leading global responses to the virus. Dr Tedros - who has never practised as a medical doctor - is a career politician who was born in what is now Eritrea, began work under the Communist Derg junta, came to study in the UK, then rose to the top of Ethiopia's government first as Health Minister and then Foreign Minister before being elected to lead the WHO in 2017. He is now facing heavy criticism over his handling of the pandemic, especially for praise he heaped on China's communist party for its response - hailing the regime's 'commitment to transparency' and saying the speed with which it detected the virus was 'beyond words'. That has led to allegations - loudly made by Donald Trump - that the WHO is 'China-centric', a position that the US President has promised to 'look into'. Trump has now suspended US funding to the WHO until an investigation has been carried out, while suggesting that they withheld information on the virus. Indeed, it is not the first time that Dr Tedros has been accused of cosying up to China. Shortly after his election victory in 2017, it was alleged that Chinese diplomats had been heavily involved in lobbying for him. UN records also show that Chinese contributions to both Ethiopia's aid budget and the WHO have substantially increased during times when he was in top leadership positions. Shortly after his election to the WHO, a report in The Times said: 'Chinese diplomats had campaigned hard for the Ethiopian, using Beijing's financial clout and opaque aid budget to build support for him among developing countries.' DrTedros - who is married and has five children - was born in 1965 in Asmara, which was part of Ethiopia at the time but is now in Eritrea. As a child he saw his younger brother die to an infection, which he believes was measles, which he later said spurred his determination to work on health and health policy. He graduated from university in Ethiopia in 1986 with a degree in biology and went to work as a health official in the regime of Marxist dictatorMengistu Haile Mariam, while the country was ruled by the Derg military junta. According to the BBC, Dr Tedros then joined the hard-left TPLF - which started life as a Communist party and played a major role in overthrowing Mariam in 1991. It later became part of theEPRDF, a coalition of left-wing parties that ruled Ethiopia until last year. Around the same time as Mariam's ouster, Dr Tedros left Ethiopia and came to the UK where he studied at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, graduating with Masters of Science in Immunology of Infectious Diseases in 1992. He then went on to study at the University of Nottingham, where he received a PhD in community health in 2000. After this, he returned to Ethiopia where he joined the health ministry and rose through the ranks from regional health minister all the way to national Minister for Heath - a position he took up in 2005. During his tenure, which lasted until 2012, he was widely praised for opening thousands of health centres, employing tens of thousands of medics, bringing down rates of HIV/AIDS, measles and malaria, as well as bringing information technology and the internet into the heath system. In November 2012 he was promoted to Foreign Minister, and was widely hailed for helping to negotiate a boost in UN funding for Ethiopia, including as part of theAddis Ababa Action Agenda. Indeed, UN funding records show that around this time the country received millions in additional funding - including from China, which had previously given little or nothing to support the country. In 2015 and 2016 China gave some $16million to Ethiopia in spending commitments and cash contributions, largely in support of food or refugee programmes. In 2011, just before Dr Tedros took up the role, and in 2017, just after he left, China handed over another $44million in commitments and contributions. Its total contributions outside of this period, dating back to the year 2000, were just $345,000. In 2017, Dr Tedros left the Ethiopian government and entered the running for Director-General of the WHO as the tenure of Dr Margaret Chan, a Canadian-Chinese physician, was coming to an end. The election was the first to take place under a system of polling all UN member states as part of a secret ballot. Previously, leaders were chosen by a closed-door vote of an executive committee. Eventually the field was boiled down to two candidates - Dr Tedros and Briton Dr David Nabarro, a life-long physician who had helped lead UN responses to previous outbreaks including bird flu, the cholera outbreak in Haiti, and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Dr Tedros won the ballot by a reported 133 votes to 50, becoming the first African leader of the WHO and the first non-medic to hold the role. His victory came in part thanks to 50 out of 54 African states voting for him. However, he quickly mired himself in controversy by recommending African dictator Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador, amid allegations he was trying to repay favours granted during the election. There were reports that the move was also intended to reward China, a long-time supporter of Mugabe, for using its influence to have him elected. The Timesadded: 'China has praised the authoritarian development model of Ethiopia's regime, which rules under emergency powers and has put down pro-democracy protests.' During the 2017 election itself, several groups within Ethiopia opposed Dr Tedros's appointment due to his links with theTPLF and allegations that they stifled journalists and repressed minorities. Dr Tedros was also accused of covering up three separate cholera outbreaks in 2006, 2008 and 2011 by mis-reporting it as 'watery diarrhea', allegations he dismissed as a 'smear campaign' by his British rival. Following his election to the WHO, Dr Tedros vowed to reform the organisation by placing an emphasis on universal healthcare at its centre while also increasing funding. Further UN funding records show that, during his tenure, assessed contributions to the WHO by China have also risen significantly - from roughly $23million in 2016 to $38million in 2019. China has also committed to a further $57million in funding in 2020, though has yet to pay the balance. Meanwhile funding from other major world economies - including the US, Russia, Japan and Germany - has remained largely flat or even fallen over the same period. Assessed contributions make up only around a quarter of the WHO's budget, the rest of which comes from donations. "
"The first results from an international experimental US antiviral drug are promising, even as a trial of the same drug in China shuts down. More than half of a group of severely ill coronavirus patients from the US, Canada, Europe and Japan improved after taking remdesivir made by California-based Gilead Sciences. Originally developed as a treatment for Ebola, the medication has been shown to fight against coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is a cousin of the new virus. At the same time, a trial in China testing the drug in those with mild symptoms of the virus was suspended due to a lack of eligible patients. However, some analysts believe that the trial was suspended because the drug was not proved to be effective Currently, there are no drugs are approved for treating COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. At least five large studies are testing remdesivir, and the company also has given it to more than 1,700 patients on a case-by-case emergency basis. In the study, whose results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday, 53 patients between aged 23 to 82 were studied, All were hospitalized either in the US, Canada, Europe or Japan - and 34 were sickenough to require breathing machines. They were given the drug through an IV for 10 days or as long as they tolerated it. After an average of 18 days, more than two-thirds of patients, 36 patients, needed less oxygen or breathing machine support. Nearly half of patients were discharged from the hospital. However, there's no way to know the odds of improving without the drug because there was no comparison group, doctors reported Friday. Seven patients died, nearly all of them over age 70. That 13 percent mortality rate is lower than seen in some other reports, but no true comparisons can be made without a study rigorously testing the drug in similar groups of patients, the authors noted. A dozen patients had serious problems but it's not clear whether they were from the drug or their disease. Problems included septic shock and trouble with kidneys and other organs. Four discontinued treatment because of health problems they developed. Dr Derek Angus, critical care chief at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who wasn't involved with the research, said the recovery rate is good but 'there is no way of knowing from this series if remdesivir was helpful.' Meanwhile, in China, a trial testing the drughas been suspended due to a lack of eligible patients, according to a website maintained by the US government. Earlier, another trial in China testing the drug in those with severe COVID-19 was terminated because no eligible patients could be enrolled. The study was conducted by researchers in China and the suspension was posted on Wednesday on clinicaltrials.gov, a database maintained by the US National Institutes of Health. According to Gilead, the Phase III trial for mild to moderate patients ended had due to lack of patients to enroll. Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, wrote that the company is still continuing studies in patients, but pulling data from the China trial. 'Key upcoming readouts for the drug remain the Gilead-sponsored studies in severe (late April, though lack of a control arm may limit interpretability) and moderate (May) COVID-19 patients. NIAID's remdesivir data may also come as early as May,' he wrote, according to BioSpace. He believes that halting the trial is evidence that the drug had limited efficacy. 'We continue to believe that while remdesivir showed a promising signal of activity in the recent open label compassionate use published data, the fact that no data has been revealed from the truncated severe study in China - the only randomized study thus far - despite today's update also indicated it had enrolled a reasonably robust number of patients (n=237), suggests any benefits observed were likely inconclusive and maintains our view that the likelihood of remdesivir demonstrating substantial activity remains at best 50/50m,' Abrahams wrote."
"Franklin Graham, the evangelical pastor whose group Samaritan's Purse is running a field hospital in New York's Central Park, says he is being harassed for insisting his hospital workers are opposed to gay marriage. Mr Graham - who has a long history of anti-LGBTQ beliefs - makes all volunteers agree to a Statement of Faith which includes the line 'marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female'. However, Graham has since posted in a lengthy Facebook message about how he has been harassed by 'elected officials and others' in New York. 'While so many have expressed their appreciation and support, sadly some New York officials and a special interest group have expressed concerns or outright opposition to the presence of Samaritan's Purse and our field hospital in Central Park. They include:Eight Democratic members of New York's Congressional delegation in Washington, D.C., The New York City Commission on Human Rights, The Reclaim Pride Coalition,' Graham alleged. 'While our Scriptural belief in marriage between a man and a woman seems particularly offensive to representatives of these three groups, we don't believe this is the time or place to wage this debate. Samaritan's Purse is a decidedly Christian private relief organization, funded almost entirely by individuals around the world who share our passion for providing aid to victims of war, disease, disaster, poverty, famine and persecution—and doing so in Jesus' Name,' the pastor continued. 'It seems tone-deaf to be attacking our religious conviction about marriage at the very moment thousands of New Yorkers are fighting for their lives and dozens of Samaritan's Purse workers are placing their lives at risk to provide critical medical care.' 'If any of these groups had funded and erected their own emergency field hospitals to serve COVID-19 patients in Central Park, we would join what we believe would be most New Yorkers—and Americans—in applauding and praying for them, not harassing them. Last month, while setting up the temporary structure, in an attempt to allay fears because of the charity's anti-gay stance,Samaritan's Purse told state lawmakers that they would require those working at the hospital to sign an additional second pledge vowing not to discriminate against patients according to the New York Times. Nonetheless, Graham justified his position by saying the group had a right to 'lawfully hire staff who share our Christian beliefs' because it is a religious charity. The hospital consists of 14 tents with room for 68 beds, staffed by a team of more than 70 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel and relief specialists. There are also 10 ICU beds equipped with ventilators. The hospital has admitted 119 patients during their first two weeks of operation. Last week, activistWilliam Talen - best known for his satirical character Reverend Billy - was arrested at the hospital and escorted away by six police officers, one clutching what is believed to be Talen's rainbow flag. As he was being escorted away, the 69-year-old shouted: 'They have no business being in New York City. They are the virus.' Talen allegedly jumped the perimeter of the hospital and planted a flag on the grounds before he was arrested. Last month, the makeshift field hospital was constructed in Central Park in just 48 hours to take the pressure off overwhelmed hospitals in the city. Samaritan's Purse COVID Response team leadDr Elliott Tenpenny toldMSNBC: 'We're taking more patients all the time to help the people in New York City. 'In partnership with Mount Sinai, we're accepting patients and each day a certain number come through and we receive them throughout the day. He added: 'The challenge is those two hospitals [Mount Sinai hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens], those two boroughs, are really the ones that have been hit the hardest early on in this pandemic in New York City. 'We've been able to serve a great function here by offloading them and allowing them to treat more people. 'This virus doesn't just attack older Americans. There is greater risk for severe cases. 'This virus doesn't care who you are. It doesn't care how old you are. It's attacking people of all ages.' The organization is also running a field hospital in Italy, the first time they have had two facilities open simultaneously. He added: 'We've only been open three or four days, but if our patients in Italy are any indication they could be here weeks. Two to three weeks even, the sicker patients.'"
"Kellyanne Conway, during an appearance on Fox News Wednesday, suggested there were 18 previous viruses ahead of the coronavirus that could have become pandemics and that the World Health Organization was acting irresponsible when it came to global well-being. 'This is COVID-19, not COVID-1 folks, and so you would think the people in charge of the World Health Organization, facts and figures, would be on top of that,' Conway, who serves as White House counselor, charged during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends.' The disease was named COVID-19 because it's from thecoronavirus family - which can include strains that mimic the common cold - and was first detected in the year 2019. And Conway's remarks took a different tone when she spoke to reporters in the White House driveway after her appearance on Fox News. 'It's called covid-19; not covid-20. It originated in 2019 even though the WHO called it a global pandemic sometime in March of 2020. So they knew for a while and they dragged their feet it looks like,' she said. Her attacks on the WHO came after President Donald Trump announced the United States was suspending the United States' contribution - which was $453 million in fiscal year 2019 - to the organization. Covid is a contraction of coronavirus disease, and the 19 is because it was first identified in 2019. If there had been a strain in 2018, it would have been Covid-18, and a strain in 2025 would be Covid-25. 'Is it so much to ask that the minor dividend, the minor return on our investment, would be for the WHO to be honest about the origins of the virus in Wuhan? About the fact that it was human-to-human transmission? They lied about that, or weren't transparent about that, so this is about transparency and accountability,' Conway said during her Fox News appearance. She denied the organization was being used by the administration as a 'scape goat.' President Trump has sought to blame an array of officials and organizations for the coronavirus pandemic, including governors and China. 'They're not a scape goat,' Conway told reporters at the White House. 'At the very very least we should expect a return on that investment that the WHO tells us the truth about this virus, about its origins, whether it can be transmitted human to human – they denied that – they made a very political statement that when the president shut down travel to China,' she said. 'Lying about it and not being transparent – let's at least hit pause and investigate that. Nobody's scape goating them. We're asking them why they didn't do their job,' she added. Trump announced on Tuesday that he was suspending funding while an investigation into the WHO's handling of the pandemic is carried out. The move was not a surprise. The president has railed against the WHO for days as part of his desire to put the blame for the pandemic on anyone other than his administration. Trump singled out what he called the WHO's 'dangerous and costly decision' to argue against international travel bans to combat the pandemic. While praising his own decision to limit travel to and from China on January 31 - a month after the first cases of the disease were reported - Trump added: 'Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world. 'The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures.' The U.S. is the largest single contributor to the WHO, paying in some $893million between 2018 and 2019 which made up around 15 per cent of the agency's total budget during that period. Trump also said he was concerned about the World Health Organization praising China's transparency about the virus. But he was questioned on that given that he, too, praised China's transparency. Several days before Trump decided to announce the partial travel ban, he praised China's efforts in combatting the coronavirus. 'China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,' Trump wrote on Twitter on January 24.'It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!' Trump sporadically praised China through February and March as well - while also occasionally calling coronavirus the 'China virus.' On Tuesday when asked if he was being hypocritical, Trump answered, 'I'm always respectful of China,' before bringing up the amount of money he believed he brought in because of the trade war, brushing off the question. Conway clarified Trump's early praise of China's transparency on Wednesday. 'Because we figured we were getting transparent and factual information. And the WHO has responsibility in that too. And a week later the President did what people criticized him for doing that saved lives – he did the travel ban,' she said."
"President Donald Trump's new expansive list of CEO and executive advisors on reopening the country includes a smattering of critics and people who have ridiculed him in public comments in the past. The comments have ranged from criticism of the president's ego, his ability to plan for the future, his personality, to jokes about his multiple bankruptcies as a private businessman. One of the members Trump announced Tuesday, former George W. Bush economic advisor Larry Lindsey was referred to the president as a '10 out of 10 narcissist.' According to Politico, Lindsey gave a talk to House leaders and committee chairmen, where he shared what he learned from two psychologists he lined up to analyze Trump's behavior. Lindsey said China viewed Trump as a '10-out-of-10 narcissist.' Lindsey said Trump had the long-term decision-making capacity ofan 'empty chair.' Another advisor, billionaire Mark Cuban, endorsed Hillary Clinton into 2016 and called Trump a 'jagoff.' 'Leadership is not yelling and screaming and intimidating.You know what we call a person like that in Pittsburgh? A jagoff,' Cuban continued. 'Is there any bigger jagoff in the world than Donald Trump?' he said. Days ago, Cubantold 'Fox News Sunday' he didn't share Trump's view that the country would soon bounce back. 'I wish he was right, but he's not,' Cuban said. 'I think it's going to be slower. I think there's going to be so many different ways we'll have to adapt to this new abnormal,' he added. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, has repeatedly taken aim at Trump. In 2018 Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, said: 'I think I could beat Trump. 'Because I'm as tough as he is, I'm smarter than he is. I would be fine. He could punch me all he wants, it wouldn't work with me. I'd fight right back.' For full measure he added: 'And by the way this wealthy New Yorker actually earned his money. It wasn't a gift from Daddy.' Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also made it onto Trump's list, although Trump has attacked Bezos repeatedly and recently railed against the Postal Service, which is seeking a multi-billion bailout due to the coronavirus and which is a critical part of the Amazon delivery service. Trump didn't include Bezos when he read through 120 names at the Rose Garden at the White House Tuesday. But his name appeared on a list sent out by the White House. Bezos owns the Washington Post, which changed its motto to 'Democracy Dies in Darkness' after Trump took office. Trump has repeatedly attacked him and has mocked him as 'Jeff Bozo.' Amazon has accused Trump of putting on 'improper pressure' that hurt Amazon and contributed to its loss of a $10 billion Pentagon contract. Another member,George W. Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who said it was 'out of bounds' for Trump to ask Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. In October 2016, when his notorious 'grab them by the p***y' tape came to light, she tweeted: 'Enough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw. 'As a Republican, I hope to support someone who has the dignity and stature to run for the highest office in the greatest democracy on earth.' Another advisor, New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft, entered into a plea deal with prosecutors after being arrested in a sting last year for solicitation. Also advising Trump is SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Musk walked away from a Trump business advisory council after the president pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change. 'Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,' Musk wrote. The White House release the names of even more people than Trump himself read out in the Rose Garden, grouped by themes.

"Dr Anthony Fauci has stopped short of naming a single state that he believes can reopen before May 1 like President Donald Trump has suggested. His refusal to name a state came just hours after he was absent from the White House coronaviruspress briefing on Tuesday after calling Trump's lengthy Q&A sessions 'draining' and his May 1 deadline 'overly optimistic'. It follows more rumors of tensions between Dr Fauci and the President, who was on Sunday forced to deny her would fire America's top expert on infectious diseases. In an NBC interview on Tuesday night, Dr Fauci was asked what states, if any, could reopen after Trump floated that some could reopen even before his federal guidelines expire.  'I'm certain... that he's talking about some of the states that have low levels, low density of population and a lot of geographic land,' Fauci said without naming possible locations. 'I haven't gone state by state through them. There is going to be a great deal of variability there. It's not going to be one size fits all.' Hours earlier, Trump had said at a White House press conference thatsome states could reopen before May 1 - which is the date his '30 Days to Slow the Spread' of the coronavirus ends. 'The day must be close because certain states as you know are in much different condition. It's going to be very, very close. Maybe even before the date of May 1st,' he said. It followed a day of constitutional arguing between Trump and governors including New York's Andrew Cuomo after the President claimed he had 'total authority' to force states to reopen and accused dissenters of 'mutiny'. President Donald Trump on Tuesday abandoned his push for 'total' authority to reopen the country and said he would leave the decision in the hands of the individual governors of each state. Facing angry governors and a violation of the U.S. Constitution, the president tried to spin his decision as one of graciousness, saying he would be 'authorizing' the governors to make their own decisions. 'I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly. And I will then be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening, very powerful reopening plan of their estate in a time in a manner which is most appropriate,' Trump said at his daily White House press briefing. He backed down from his threat to withhold aid from states who wouldn't fall in line and attempted to paint his relationship with the governors as strong and respectful. 'The governors will be very, very respectful of the presidency,' he noted. 'This isn't me. This is the presidency. The presidency has such a great importance in terms of what we are doing. You can talk about constitution. You can talk about federalism. You can talk about whatever you want. But the best way, I am talking now from a managerial standpoint, to let individual governors run individual states and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them.' He went on to praise the governors for their work after accusing them of mutiny when many of them - led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo - said they would decide what was best for their state, not the president.  But Trump later on Tuesday abandoned his push for 'total' authority to reopen the country and said he would leave the decision in the hands of the individual governors of each state. He said: 'We don't want to put pressure on anybody. I'm not going to put any pressure on any governor to open.' Last night, Dr Fauci went on to say that before states reopen, it was imperative that each area was equipped to be able to quickly identify, isolate and treat any new cases to avoid another surge. 'Minimum thing is you have got to be able to identify, isolate, get out of circulation and do adequate and appropriate contract tracing as new cases arrive,' he said. 'The real proof of success if how quickly you identify them... and you do contact tracing so you don't have the beginning of a peak.' The states with the lowest levels coronavirus and large wilderness areas that Fauci could have been talking about include Wyoming, where there is one coronavirus death and 282 cases and Montana which has seven deaths and 394 cases. Dr Fauci stopped short of saying whether he believed the worst of the pandemic was over after the US death toll rose to nearly 26,000 and infections increased to 615,000. He said looking at epicenter New York, there was no doubt there was a flattening out occurring there. Earlier on Tuesday, Dr Fauci echoed his comments saying that a May 1 target date for reopening the economy was 'a bit overly optimistic' due to a lack of critical testing and tracing procedures. It comes after Dr Fauci, who has become a trusted national figure during the coronavirus outbreak, told the Associated Pressthat the length of Trump's daily White House briefings was 'really draining.' 'If I had been able to just make a few comments and then go to work, that would have really been much better,' he said. 'It isn't the idea of being there and answering questions, which I really think is important for the American public. It's the amount of time.' He was noticeably absent from Tuesday night's briefing during which Trump appeared to back off his previous claim of absolute authority to decide when the time was right to act to reopen states. A leaked strategy devised by government officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revealed the government is lobbying to re-open parts of the US by May 1, beginning with schools and churches. The strategy, first obtained by the Washington Post, offers guidance to state and local governments as for how best to ease mitigation efforts and phase out restrictions, such as strict stay-at-home orders, to ensure safe re-openings. The coalition task force has been working on the plan for the past week. Its contents have since been discussed by the White House's coronavirustask force as the Trump administration presses forward with its plans to get Americans out of their homes and back to work as soon as possible. Appearing to be an early draft, the document contains scant instructions for gradual re-openings of institutions such as churches, schools, child-care facilities, summer camps, national parks and restaurants. According to the Post, two anonymous administration officials said the president wants the plan finalized in the coming days in a bid to re-open 'low-risk' states by May 1. Hours after suggesting that the bipartisan concerns of governors about his assertion of power would amount to an insurrection, Trump abruptly reversed course Tuesday, saying he would leave it to governors to determine the right time and manner to revive activity in their states. He said he would be speaking with governors, probably on Thursday, to discuss his plans. 'The governors are responsible,' Trump said. 'They have to take charge.' Still, he insisted: 'The governors will be very, very respectful of the presidency.' Democratic and Republican governors had sounded the alarm after Trump asserted Monday that he and he alone would determine when and how to reopen the economy, despite clear constitutional limitations on federal powers. Trump said Tuesday he would be authorizing governors 'of each individual state to implement a reopening - and a very powerful reopening - plan of their state at a time and in a matter as most appropriate.' Trump added that he would support moves by states that haven't been hit hard by the outbreak to ease restrictions even before federal guidelines on social distancing expire April 30. Trump said the country would open up 'in beautiful little pieces,' adding that some states with low rates of infection 'have fewer people and they have lots of room.' It's unclear if any states are actively considering reopening their economies before May 1. In a departure from recent tradition, Trump ended his daily briefing without turning the mic over to federal health experts who have cautioned against moving too quickly to restart economic activity. Dr.Anthony Fauci,the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the face of America's effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, believes pro sports can return in 2020, albeit with some major caveats such as empty stadiums and frequent screenings. 'There's a way of doing that,' Fauci said during an interview with Snapchat's Peter Hamby. 'Nobody comes to the stadium. Put [the players] in big hotels, wherever you want to play, keep them very well surveilled. ... Have them tested every single week and make sure they don't wind up infecting each other or their family, and just let them play the season out.' Similar suggestions have been debated both internally, among league officials and player representatives, and publicly, among fans and media. President Donald Trump on Tuesday abandoned his push for 'total' authority to reopen the country and said he would leave the decision in the hands of the individual governors of each state. Facing angry governors and a violation of the U.S. Constitution, the president tried to spin his decision as one of graciousness, saying he would be 'authorizing' the governors to make their own decisions. 'I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly. And I will then be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening, very powerful reopening plan of their estate in a time in a manner which is most appropriate,' Trump said at his daily White House press briefing. He backed down from his threat to withhold aid from states who wouldn't fall in line and attempted to paint his relationship with the governors as strong and respectful. 'The governors will be very, very respectful of the presidency,' he noted. 'This isn't me. This is the presidency. The presidency has such a great importance in terms of what we are doing. You can talk about constitution. You can talk about federalism. You can talk about whatever you want. But the best way, I am talking now from a managerial standpoint, to let individual governors run individual states and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them.' He went on to praise the governors for their work after accusing them of mutiny when many of them - led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo - said they would decide what was best for their state, not the president. 'The governors are responsible, they have to take charge and do a great job,' he said, a remarkable change from his angry tone on Monday, when Trump proclaimed he alone has theauthority to reopen the economy, which is suffering in the wake of the coronavirus. 'When somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total,' Trump said on Monday. On Tuesday, after an outpouring of criticism and waving of the constitution, Trump said:'The governors are going to be running their individual states.' Constitutional scholars and governors disagreed with the president's assessment on Monday that the power rested with him to reopen the country. All pointed to the 10th amendment of the Constitution, which gives states precedent over the federal government. Trump said some states could even reopen before May 1 - which is the date his '30 Days to Slow the Spread' of the coronavirus ends. 'The day must be close because certain states as you know are in much different condition. It's going to be very, very close. Maybe even before the date of May 1st,' he said. 'We have one country but we have lots of different pieces. It's a puzzle. We have beautiful pieces, beautiful states with capable governors. They know when it's time to open. We don't want to put pressure on anybody. I'm not going to put any pressure on any governor to open,' Trump said. Tuesday's announcement was a surrender for the president, who also threatened to withhold coronavirus aid from states if the governors didn't heed his call to reopen the country. And he charged the governors as guilty of mutiny. The film ‘Mutiny on the Bounty’ tells a fictionalized version of the real-life mutiny led by Fletcher Christian against William Bligh, captain of the HMAV Bounty, in 1789. The 1962 version starred Marlon Brando as Christian and Trevor Howard as Bligh, setting up Brando as the hero to Howard’s evil, sadistic Bligh. Bligh is a captain who commands through fear, putting his crew on limited rations and with holding water to complete their mission. But it is Bligh who steals food and taunts Christian, who is the first lieutenant. The breaking point comes when Christian gives extra water to a sick crew member in violation of Bligh’s orders. Bligh informs Christian he will hang when they reach port. The crew rebels and overcomes Bligh but Christian is merciful, putting Bligh and his associates in a boat and giving them supplies so they can make it back to Britain. Bligh does make it back where he demands the mutineers be brought back and tried. Meanwhile, Christian and the crew have found an island to live on but Christian decides he must do the right thing and return to Britain to testify against Bligh. The crew stops him by setting the ship on fire. Christian is killed trying to put out the flames. 'Tell the Democrat Governors that “Mutiny On The Bounty” was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!,' he tweeted. Cuomo led the charge in blasting Trump for his pronouncement of authority - calling him 'schizophrenic' - and said he would take him to court over the matter as a constitutional crisis began to brew. The governor claimed he didn't want to fight with the president - despite Trump 'spoiling' for one. Cuomo went on to make the point he didn't need to fight because the constitution was on the side of the states and not the federal government. 'The president is clearly spoiling for a fight on this issue,' Cuomo said at his daily press briefing in New York, referring to President Trump's mutiny tweet. 'Sometimes it takes more strength frankly to walk away from a fight than engage. The president will have no fight with me. I will not engage,' he said. The governor also spent several minutes lecturing on how the constitution favors states, essentially arguing with Trump's point via a talk on early American history. 'This is basic federalism, the role of states and the role of the federal government. It is important to get this right. The founding fathers understood and I remembered today that the balance between the state and the federal, the magnificent balance articulated in the constitution is the essence of our democracy. We don't have a king in this country. We didn't want a king, so we have a constitution and we elect the president. The states, the colonies formed the federal government. The federal government did not form the states,' he said. He went on to quote Alexander Hamilton, the first treasury secretary who was one of the framers of the Constitution. Hamilton's Federalist Papers have been used by courts to determine the intentions of the founding fathers. 'Hamilton, who in many ways was representative of this discussion of the balance of power, state governments possess inherent advantages, and will forever preclude the possibility of federal encroachment on the states. The federal head is repugnant to every rule of political calculations. Strong language but that was a premise,' Cuomo said. The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Cuomo added he was willing to talk to Trump at any time. 'I've always had an open line of communication with him. At different times in the past, when he hasn't been happy with me and I haven't been throwing bouquets to him, we've always communicated. I'm sure we will communicate now,' he said. The standoff began duringa heated press conference inside the White House on Monday evening, when Trump claimed that his office holds 'absolute power' over the shutdowns prompted by the novel coronavirusoutbreak - hours after Cuomo and eight other Democratic governors unveiled a pact to work together to co-ordinate the reopenings of their respective states. 'When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,' Trump told reporters in response to the announcement, declining to specify where his authority to overrule states resides when pressed by DailyMail.com. Instead, he reiterated: 'The federal government has absolute power. ButCuomo pointed out Trump left it up to the states to buy their own medical supplies and to issue stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus crisis, arguing the president can't accede that responsibility to the states and then contend he is an absolute authority. 'This is a 180. I have total authority. I'm going to tell the states what to do. So it makes no sense. It is schizophrenic,' Cuomo said Tuesday morning on CNN's 'New Day.' The New York governor made it clear he would not obey any such order from Trump to reopen his state, adding he would take the matter to the courts to let them rule on it. 'If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn't do it. And we would have a constitutional challenge between the state and the federal government and that would go into the courts, and that would be the worst possible thing he could do at this moment would be to act dictatorial and to act in a partisan divisive way,' Cuomo said. The director of the Centers for Disease Control called the World Health Organization 'a great partner' one day after President Trump announced he would halt the group's funding over its coronavirus response. Dr. Robert Redfield appeared on 'CBS This Morning' and refused to say how the funding freeze would impact the world's ability to combat the coronavirus pandemic, saying he'd prefer to leave 'geo-political issues' for those with that expertise. 'WHO has been a long-term and still is a great partner for us,' Redfield said, adding that 'we're continuing to work side by side to do the best that we can to limit the spread of disease and to protect the American people.' CBS News' Anthony Mason brought up comments made by Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, who savaged Trump on Twitter over his decision to cut off funds in order to investigate WHO's coronavirus response. 'Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds,' Gates tweeted early Wednesday morning. 'Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever,' the billionaire added. Redfield wouldn't address Gates' comments head-on. Trump first flirted with cutting off WHO's funding a week ago, telling reporters that the group's response to the pandemic had been too 'China-centric,' and suggested WHO was engaged in a cover-up. On Tuesday during a Rose Garden press conference, the president made his decision official. He expressed that his biggest beef with WHO was that the organization didn't support a travel ban from China - and he did. 'Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China accelerated the pandemic all around the world,' Trump said. 'The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days.' 'The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures,' Trump said. The president implemented a partial travel ban on incoming flights from China in late January. The WHO generally doesn't support travel bans because it could lead countries to under-report cases of disease anddestabilize economies, while a country is trying to fight an epidemic. 'Although travel restrictions may intuitively seem like the right thing to do, this is not something that WHO usually recommends,' saidTarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson, when discussing the China travel banin late January. 'This is because of the social disruption they cause and the intensive use of resources required,'Jašarević said. The U.S. is the single largest contributor to WHO. The country paid around $893 million to the organization between 2018 and 2019, which made up about 15 per cent of the agency's total budget. "
"A fortnight ago, my boyfriend reset the wi-fi without bothering to check with me, unwittingly throwing me off an important Zoom video call and making me look like a confused baby boomer who can’t work technology. Normally I might have got angry with him, but we were a week into lockdown and I knew we were stuck in our desert island living quarters for the rest of the day. So instead, I deployed my own superior tactic: secret revenge. Rather than storm next door and confront him, I stayed in my bedroom-cum-office, leant over to his side of the bed and took his book off the nightstand. I then moved his bookmark three pages forward. A fight had been avoided, but I was satisfied because I knew I’d robbed him of some joy in those few pages. That evening he picked up his book, none the wiser. His mildly confused face as he tried to follow the plot was all the ‘apology’ I needed. ‘Good book?’ I asked innocently. ‘Pretty good,’ he said. ‘Little confusing though.’ Some other minor victories of mine which he knows nothing about: me ‘accidentally’ finishing all the chocolate biscuits, subtly removing his beer from the online shop before the order was placed, and not reminding him about a work call that I just know he’s forgotten. In normal times, the key to a happy relationship is being good at fighting. Two people can be as compatible as Ant and Dec in every way, and in the bedroom, too, but if they’re incompatible in an argument, the relationship is doomed. After a decade together, my boyfriend Adam and I have managed to finesse our epic fights to a flawless recipe. It involves a few minutes of shouting, followed by a storm-off separation. He takes a walk, I rant to my friends, then later in the day we both say sorry while sidestepping any admission of fault. A perfect cocktail. The only issue is that in lockdown he can’t just walk off any time he wants and I can’t call my pals to rant when he’s sitting in the same room. Add to this the fact we’re with each other 24 hours a day and the opportunity to argue has risen dramatically. All of which means fighting is a luxury that has gone the same way as dinner parties, on hold until we’re out of this mess. As a writer, I work from home, so I’m used to a day spent indoors, but what I’m not used to is my lawyer boyfriend infiltrating my work space. I know he’s been forced inside, but somehow it doesn’t feel like we’re both working from home: it feels like he’s camped out in my office, ruining my routine, and commenting on how many snacks I eat. From looking at social media, you might think arguing has been conveniently paused, that families are blissfully baking banana bread together and cutting each other’s hair in front of the Netflix must-watch Tiger King. But we all need to let off steam somehow. In a now-deleted Facebook post, the Malaysian women’s ministry suggested wives ‘avoid nagging’ their husbands at this difficult time. On top of this, while the rest of us rotate between ‘day’ pyjamas and ‘night’ pyjamas, it advised women to wear make-up and continue to dress well. The horror and ridicule that greeted these suggestions eventually elicited an apology and the clarification they were only trying to maintain ‘positive relationships among family members’. It’s the right idea, but entirely the wrong method — dressing up and pretending not to find my boyfriend annoying would only make me more likely to tear him off a strip in the long run. No, it is my belief that small acts of passive aggression are the only way to keep the peace in lockdown, when blow-ups are so highly ill-advised. I feel I must now add a caveat: my revenge is mostly in jest. There is a serious issue with isolation increasing incidents of domestic violence. So only use these helpful tips if you’re in a good relationship and, like me, have a healthy hatred for your other half. Allow me to set the scene: a few days after the bookmark incident and after a stressful day, I cosied up on the sofa to watch the latest episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race together, only to be told that as my working day had gone on too long, he had watched it without me. In the best of times, skipping ahead on shows is a cardinal sin, so when it was time to pass him his glasses as we watched the subtitled family drama Shtisel, I pushed my thumbs onto each lens, leaving an oily smudge. If I couldn’t watch my show, then it seemed fair he couldn’t see his. He hasn’t noticed any of my little revenges, or rather he hasn’t realised their calculated origins. But that’s part of their beauty. We sidestep any confrontation and I feel like I’ve received an apology without hearing one. They also give me the illusion of control, in a situation where we all have so little. Most couples will be going through episodes of feeling a little unhinged. You can hate your boyfriend, and still love him; you can feel lucky to be isolated with your wife and still miss your alone time. If you need to move a bookmark to feel better, then go ahead. And just to prove that you’re not abnormal, when I shared my tactic on Twitter, I got an avalanche of revenge plots. One of my followers said they took the beer from the fridge and put it in the cupboard so it would warm up, while another suggested swapping the Earl Grey and English breakfast tea. Other devious plans included pulling the phone charger out of the socket ever so slightly, so your other half’s battery stays depleted. At its best, a little morsel of revenge is something you’ll be able to tell your partner at a later time and hopefully they’ll laugh it off as part of your cabin fever. So if you put on your glasses tomorrow and find your Daily Mail a little dog-eared and your lenses a little blurry, know that you probably did something to upset your other half. But be glad in the knowledge that you avoided a much bigger fight, and prepare to hide the loo roll at an inconvenient moment. Flora is donating her fee from this article to Refuge, a UK charity for women and children experiencing domestic violence."
"World War Two veteran Ermando Piveta, aged 99, became the oldest Brazilian to recover from the deadly coronavirus that has killed more than 100,000 people and sickened 2million across the globe. Wearing an army cap and saluting from his wheelchair, Piveta left the Armed Forces Hospital in Brasilia to an ovation from medical staff and a soldier's trumpet homage on Tuesday. 'Winning this battle was for me bigger than winning the war,' he said of his fight against an invisible enemy. 'In war you kill or live. Here you have to fight to live,' he added. Piveta was a second lieutenant in the Brazilian Army forces during World War Two and served in Africa. The decorated war veteran's hospital discharge came on the 75th anniversary of Brazilian troops liberating the Italian town of Montese following three days of battle against the Germans. Piveta tested positive for the coronavirus two weeks ago and spent two days in the hospital's intensive care ward after he developed pneumonia. But he never needed a ventilator and recovered due to his good physical shape derived from life in the military and longevity that runs in his family, the hospital's director said. Piveta's release from hospital was a bright moment in an otherwise darkening scenario as the epidemic hit Brazil with force this week. The health ministry reported the coronavirus has infected 28,320 people and killed 1,736 people as of Wednesday. At least 204 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The ravaging virus has left 133,261 people dead and another 2,034,425 sickened in the world."
"Exclusive DailyMail.com drone footage shows a 1.5 mile-long line of cars outside a drive-thru food distribution site in South Florida where thousands of people are seeking help to feed their families amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of cars packed bumper to bumper on a roadway in Sunrise on Wednesday waiting to pick up essential food items from Feeding South Florida (FSF). Similar long lines are cropping up around the Miami metro area on a daily basis as FSF holds dozens of distribution events to keep up with soaring demand from families hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis gripping the nation. The organization said its seen a 600 percent increase in the number of people asking for food over the past couple weeks amid widespread layoffs affecting an estimated 500,000 Floridians. The drive-thru at the Sunrise Tennis Club Park shown in DailyMail.com's drone footage was one of six being held by FSF on Wednesday. The food bank scheduled 27 distribution events across the metropolitan area this week after last week's events drew huge crowds. Organizers said they have already given out more than 10 million pounds of food in the past few weeks, providing roughly 2.5 million meals over each seven day period. 'Our families are scared,' Paco Velez, president and CEO of Feeding South Florida, told NBC Miami. 'They don't know when they're going to get a job, if they're going to get a job, and when they're going to get food on the table. So for us it's really about ensuring that we're bringing in as much as possible and getting it on the tables of those families.' Keeping up with the massive demand has posed a challenge as the nation's food supply chain experiences disruptions due to the pandemic. 'As we go and look at purchasing product from our national relationships you see that there is a two week, three week, sometimes even a four week lag time,' Velez said. 'Some of the items we are looking at they tell us we won't be able to get it until mid-May.' But waiting weeks isn't an option for FSF, so instead they're focusing on supply from farmers. 'We're trying to have as many relationships as possible with as many growers as we can as well as with as many manufacturers as we can,' Velez said. FSF is now operating 24 hours a day, which required hiring more staff and volunteers - subsequently tripling the organization's costs, Velez said. Each car that passes through FSF distribution sites is given a crate of food, typically containing items such as milk, chicken, apples, tomatoes, cantaloupes and eggs. Produce accounts for a large portion of the food being doled out by FSF and other charities across the nation. That's because the coronavirus outbreak has forced governments to shut down the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants, hotels, airlines, cruise ships, school cafeterias, and other businesses that serve food to customers. That means farmers who rely on these businesses to buy their crops have an excess of perishable food and nothing to do with it. Food that isn't donated to food banks is simply thrown away or turned into mulch as there is no set mechanism to efficiently redistribute the excess produce to those in need. 'The volume is at a level we've never seen before,' said Stephen Shelley, president and CEO of Farm Share. 'It is overwhelming the system.' Farm Share distributes food every day through partnerships with food pantries, churches, school, and other nonprofits. The organization has dozens of drop sites throughout Florida. It is running at maximum capacity using every one of its 25 refrigerated trucks and six warehouses to get food to those who need it. More than 472,000 Floridians have applied for unemployment in the three weeks as the number of layoffs in the US topped 10 million. Nationwide more than 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits at the end of last month - doubling a record high set just one week earlier - a sign that layoffs are accelerating in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. Mounting economic anxieties come as the coronavirus pandemic continues to claim the lives of hundreds of Americans each day, with at least 27,613 deaths and 633,380 cases reported as of Wednesday. In Florida, there are more than 22,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases to date, including 591 deaths."
"A horrifying slow motion video shows the incredible trajectory of a sneeze that may be carrying the coronavirus – up to 27 feet away. US scientists filmed a clip of a healthy person during a violent exhalation, slowed down from 25 seconds to a minute and a half. They found that found viral droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes can travel in a moist, warm atmosphere at speeds of between 33 and 100 feet per second. This creates an infectious and 'turbulent' gas cloud capable of reaching somewhere between 23 feet to 27 feet (seven metres to eight metres) away. A moist and warm atmosphere within the turbulent gas cloud allows the contained droplets to evade evaporation for much longer than usual. The study suggests the UK government's coronavirus social distancing limit – 2 metres, or 6.5 feet – is at least four times too short if sneezing is taken into account. Scroll down for video Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), Professor Bourouiba says today's social distancing measures are based on outdated models. The virus, called COVID-19,is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms including a sore throat, headache, fever, cough or trouble breathing. Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure. This is because they do not account for the possibility of a hot and moist gas cloud, which is capable of sustaining the viral droplets for longer distances. 'Although such social distancing strategies are critical in the current time of pandemic, it may seem surprising that the current understanding of the routes of host-to-host transmission in respiratory infectious diseases are predicated on a model of disease transmission developed in the 1930s that, by modern standards, seems overly simplified,' she says. 'Implementing public health recommendations based on these older models may limit the effectiveness of the proposed interventions. 'These distances are based on estimates of range that have not considered the possible presence of a high-momentum cloud carrying the droplets long distances.' Droplets that settle along the trajectory of a sneeze can contaminate surfaces, while the rest remain trapped and clustered in the moving cloud. Eventually the 'turbulent gas cloud' loses momentum and the remaining droplets within the cloud evaporate. The rate at which these droplets eventually evaporate depends on their size, the speed of the gas cloud and ambient environment conditions such as temperature and humidity. Under higher temperatures, the lifetime of a droplet could be extended by up to 1,000 – or from a fraction of a second to several minutes. But even after evaporation, 'droplet nuclei' may stay suspended in the air for hours, getting caught in airflows from ventilation or air conditioning systems, such as in supermarkets or even hospitals. Viral particles could be found in the ventilation systems in hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19, according to a report from China earlier this year. 'Given the turbulent puff cloud dynamic model, recommendations for separations of three feet to six feet (one metre to two metres) may underestimate the distance, timescale, and persistence over which the cloud and its pathogenic payload travel, thus generating an underappreciated potential exposure range for a healthcare worker,' she said. 'For these and other reasons, wearing of appropriate personal protection equipment is vitally important for health care workers caring for patients who may be infected, even if they are farther than six feet away from a patient.' Outside of hospitals, Brits are now finding themselves in close quarters with others on a daily basis in places liked cramped supermarkets that don't accommodate the recommended social distancing requirements. The UK government saysCOVID-19 spreads through close sustained contact with someone who has the virus, such as being within 2 metres of someone for longer than 15 minutes."
"Lyft has announced a new pilot program that will make its drivers available to pick up and deliver essential goods to a range of local government agencies, healthcare companies, and businesses. Called Essential Deliveries, the program is currently being tested in Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Orlando, Phoenix, San Francisco, San Diego, San Antonio, and Seattle. So far the program has been used for a variety of tasks, including bringing supplies to food banks, and delivering meals to health care providers at hospitals. Through a partnership with Dole Packaging, the Essential Deliveries program has been used to bring canned goods from the company's warehouses to assisted living facilities. Lyft is also working with the Georgia-based non-profit Army of Angels to help deliver lunches to low income families with school age children. 'While schools are closed, many students go without school breakfast, lunch and dinner,' Greg Valla, an Advisor with Army of Angels, said in a prepared statement. 'For a variety of reasons, some are unable to access the school meals being distributed at select schools, and Army of Angels helps bridge the gap,' said 'We’re fortunate that Lyft stepped in to deliver food to students and their families who otherwise would simply not be able to eat during this time.' Lyft says it expects to continue expanding the number of cities Essential Deliveries operates in over the coming weeks. The company is planning a number of other projects for the Essential Deliveries program, including working with non-profits like Loaves & Fishes in Charlotte, North Carolina and Urban Recipes in Atlanta to bring donations to local food banks. In Los Angeles, the company is working with the City Council on several projects, including a plan to deliver care packages to health care workers assembled by local Girl Scouts. The company is also planning to work with local restaurants to deliver takeout meals from restaurants to communities in need, which could help keep local businesses from going out of business. 'Surviving this crisis will require innovation on every level,' said LA City Council member Marqueece Harris-Dawson said. 'Partnering with Lyft allows us to expand our emergency senior meals program to provide free, healthy meals directly to seniors at their homes, while keeping afloat the small businesses that contribute so much to the financial and culturally vitality of our communities.' According to Lyft, the Essential Deliveries program is both a way to serve local communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and support its drivers with steady income despite the fact that none of them are considered employees by the company.

"Employees called out a Whole Foods in Washington D.C. after six coworkers tested positive for the coronavirus and the public was not alerted. The cases popped up at a Whole Foods in Washington's Logan Circle neighborhood and stretch back to mid-March, the employees said. One worker provided emails and text messages from human resources that went out to employees at the store, alerting them co-workers tested positive for COVID-19. A spokeswoman for the store, which is not under legal requirements to report confirmed cases of COVID-19 while operating as an essential service, said it 'has undergone multiple deep cleanings and disinfections by third parties overnight and after hours.' Another employee said the store's response wasn't enough. 'This is about safety for everyone that comes in that store,' the worker said, WUSA reports. Washington has had close to 2,200 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which has been blamed for 72 deaths in the nation's capital. Across the country there have been more than 615,000 cases and 26,094 deaths. As COVID-19 has been spreading, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser a week ago required that all shoppers at grocery stores 'wear a mask or mouth covering.' Some constituents, including Washington activist and conservative Candace Owens, were unaware of the mandate and complained it was overkill and about media coverage they said was fueling overreaction. Owens said she and her British husband George Farmer in fact came to learn of the mandate when they walked into their local WholeFoods on Tuesday. She took to Twitter to detail how a police officer confronted them for not wearing masks while in the store. The 30-year-old, who made a point of declaring her backing for the police, said she could tell that the officer 'disagreed with (the policy) personally' because of how frustrated she was becoming with customers complaining about shopping carts and surfaces not being wiped down. But despite this, the officer told Owens and her British husband George Farmer, 'You guys have to wear your masks.' At the same time employees at Whole Foods and at warehouses operated by its owner, online retailer Amazon, have staged protests over concerns for workers on the frontlines providing products to Americans forced to stay-at-home because of the outbreak. Walkouts have been staged in protest of both brands. A statement provided by a WholeFoods spokeswoman after being contacted about the concerned employees at the chain's store on P Street near Logan Circle says the company is 'providing an essential service in our communities and we continue to balance that responsibility with our responsibility as an employer to ensure the health, safety and privacy of our Team Members.' The spokeswoman, speaking of the store and its confirmed cases of the virus , says 'we are meeting any notification of a diagnosis with swift and comprehensive action and communication to our Team Members in the store, and are supporting our diagnosed Team Members as well as those in quarantine.' 'Out of an abundance of caution, the store has undergone multiple deep cleanings and disinfections by third parties overnight and after hours, on top of our current enhanced daily sanitation and cleaning measures,' she explains. 'Additionally, we require daily temperature screenings and face masks for anyone working in our stores, have installed plexiglass barriers at check out, and are operating under social distancing and crowd control measures.' Workers at the store who spoke to WUSA did not want to be identified for fear of losing their employment. As for health concerns regarding the virus, the Whole Foods spokeswoman said the chain would was 'committed to taking care of and protecting our Team Members as they work to safely serve our communities during this time.' Coronavirus unmasks Amazon's stumbles at Whole Foods Amazon's moves to reduce strain on its grocery businesses by putting new online shoppers on wait lists and switching more Whole Foods resources to filling orders, is unmasking limitations at the company that was expected to upend the supermarket industry. The coronavirus pandemic should be Amazon's moment to shine. Some 90 per cent of US shoppers are under stay-at-home orders and Amazon offers grocery delivery through its 487 U.S. Whole Foods stores. Instead, Whole Foods has been overwhelmed. Amazon Prime subscribers, who pay $119 a year for free delivery, are having difficulty finding Whole Foods delivery windows, according to interviews with a dozen customers and numerous posts on social media. And when their orders do arrive, many desired products are unavailable, they say. 'I'm really surprised that they weren't able to scale for this. I was expecting them to perform better. It seems like more than anything Amazon is a supply-chain company,' said Ellen Sullivan, 37, a Chicago-based office manager. Sullivan was a regular Amazon food delivery user before COVID-19 spread widely in the US. Her last successful order was March 12, and even then, 10 of the 27 items were sold out and had to be replaced. 'Now I'm sitting on 6 pounds of frozen corn,' Sullivan said. Amazon told Reuters the setbacks are due to the spike in demand and social distancing constraints in its facilities and stores. Amazon has said it would hire an additional 75,000 people for jobs ranging from warehouse staff to delivery drivers and switched a California Amazon grocery store and a Manhattan Whole Foods to online-only as demand for orders surges. Whole Foods said its distribution network is strong and that it is working with suppliers to overcome increased demand and supply chain constraints without compromising quality standards that 'further limit the number of products we can source.' Disruptor disrupted The world's biggest online retailer sent a shock through the stodgy US supermarket business in 2017, when it bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Some experts predicted that Amazon would hasten the move to online grocery shopping and doom traditional operators like Walmart Inc and Kroger. But now Amazon is buckling under unprecedented COVID-19 supply-and-demand disruptions that sent the entire grocery industry scrambling to adapt. After expanding and speeding up Whole Foods delivery, the company is retrenching. On Sunday Amazon told Reuters it would put new grocery delivery customers on a wait list and curtail shopping hours at some Whole Foods stores to focus on orders from existing online customers. The company - which also delivers food from its own warehouses through Amazon Fresh - last month suspended its Prime Pantry delivery service for non-perishable groceries. 'They were separating themselves from the pack and that's not happening anymore. This doesn't happen to Amazon ... they don't screw up like this,' said Bill Bishop, co-founder of supermarket consultancy Brick Meets Click. Amazon inherited - and failed to address - many of the problems that are now plaguing its grocery business, a half dozen experts told Reuters. In particular, they said the e-commerce giant with $55 billion on its balance sheet did not fortify Whole Foods' foundation, which relies on outdated technology, outside suppliers and real estate unsuited for the unprecedented surge in demand. As a result, the chain's systems 'creak very badly under the strain,' Bishop said. Walmart and Kroger are also fighting to keep in-demand products like flour, toilet paper and cleaning supplies on shelves, but their regular technology investments and tight control over supply chains have been a competitive advantage over Amazon and Whole Foods, experts said. Those companies - the top two US grocery sellers - operate fleets of trucks and own dozens of large warehouses, while Amazon is more apt to outsource. Whole Foods depends on United Natural Foods (UNFI), a debt-laden grocery distributor, to supply dry grocery items like canned goods and toilet paper. UNFI told Reuters it has 'greatly increased' routes and hired over 1,000 employees to support clients. Real estate risks Whole Foods has 10 small regional warehouses for perishables like fruit, vegetables and meats. UNFI has a network of 59 distribution centers, which average about 500,000 square feet. Walmart and Kroger, which have significantly more stores, have bigger distribution centers designed to swiftly move pallets of goods. While a Walmart distribution center can deliver two full truckloads of goods to a store from a single driver, Whole Foods has difficulty digesting even one truckload, Strategic Resource Group managing director Burt Flickinger said. Whole Foods' 'center store was never the big money generator for them,' supermarket analyst David Livingston said, referring to the area where dry groceries are sold. Indeed, many stores have wine bars, hot food stations and cafes that made them popular gathering places but are of little use right now. 'They're (Whole Foods) a restaurant alternative. It's really tough,' Livingston said."
"The 1,000 ventilators promised to California hospitals by Tesla CEO Elon Musk have not been delivered, says the office of Gov. Gavin Newsom. The ventilators were set to be delivered straight to the hospitals by Tesla after Gov. Newsom announced the donation on March 23. The hospitals are yet to receive them, despite Newsom's dramatic announcement that they had arrived in the state,the Sacramento Beereported. The promise from the tech entrepreneur and billionaire came at the worst of California's outbreak when the state was desperately searching for ventilators for its most critical patients. They have since been able to donate ventilators to other states. DailyMail.com has reached out to Gov. Newsom's office and Tesla for comment. The news comes after Musk was criticized for sending Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BPAP) machines to, which are used for treating sleep apnea, to New York in boxes branded with Tesla stickers. The BPAP machines are not the type needed to treat coronavirus patients. New York City Hospitals shared an image on Twitter on March 31 thanking Musk and Tesla for delivering 40 ventilators to Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, but the photo showed BiPAP machines and not the invasive ventilators that were needed urgently by the hospitals. However, the Tesla CEO rebutted claims that the firm delivered the wrong ventilators, stating New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo had asked for both noninvasive and invasive devices, according to InterestingEngineer. The FDA recently announced that BiPAP, the ones Tesla delivered, and CPAP machines could be used as an alternative to traditional life-support ventilators, as hospitals face shortages of the larger, more complex and costly devices. 'Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients,' Musk shared in a tweet. 'Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.' Musk announced in March that he was working to provide hospitals around the world with ventilators to treat patients with the virus. The CEO had previously dismissed concerns about the outbreak, going as so far as to call the panic 'dumb.' But he seemed to quickly change his tune after the coronavirus made its way to the US – there are currently more than 633,000 cases reported in the country and the death toll has surpassed 27,0600. Musk had previously told his Twitter followers that 'if there is a shortage' he would step in to make ventilators for patients in intensive care who are struggling to stave off COVID-19. Additionally, Tesla delivered 50,000 face masks to the Seattle home of a University of Washington physician to help protect healthcare workers as they grapple with the shortages of personal protective equipment. Gov. Newsom has been criticized by state lawmakers for making the announcement about Musk's donationbefore the ventilators were delivered, sparking calls for more information on Newsom's plan to buy 400 million masks and other personal protective equipment to slow the spread of coronavirus. 'In light of the massive spending commitments made for PPE and other medical equipment, I request that the Administration launch, no later than early next week, a regularly updated webpage that describes the state's inventory of each major type of equipment and the destinations of each outgoing shipment, including quantities shipped by county, city, and categories of users including health facilities and other essential workers,' said State Sen. Holly Mitchell. On Tuesday, the governor announced a 12-point list of questions the state must have answers for before it can reopen at reduced capacity. Newsom said that the state had been able to 'buy time' with social distancing, it must anticipate a virus peak 'some time in the future'. 'As we contemplate reopening parts ofour state, we must be guided by science and data, and we must understand that things will look different than before.' He then unveiled a collection of slides with questions the state would have to address before it reopened. California is among the states that have broken with President Trump to set up their own reopening plan. He has joined with other west coast states, Washington and Oregon. It came after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday revealed he and five other east coast states had formed a 'council' to tackle the pandemic. 'California, Oregon and Washington have agreed to work together on a shared approach for reopening our economies – one that identifies clear indicators for communities to restart public life and business,' the governors said in a joint statements. The nine states combined account for more than 98 million people, close to 30 per cent of the population of the U.S., and more than 30 per cent of GDP. Despite the reported failure of Tesla to deliver ventilators, California has now begun to ship their own to other states in need, sending out hundreds of machines to New Jersey, New York and Illinois. 'Committed to the health of every Californian. Practicing our duty as Americans to take care of one another. I know other states would do the same,' Gov. Newsom said on April 7 as the machines were shipped out. 'I want to express my sincere gratitude to the people of California & to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sent us 100 ventilators overnight for use by patients here in Illinois,' Gov. JB Pritzker said in response. 'It's truly incredible to work with elected officials across the nation who are providing real leadership.' 1) How prepared is our state to test everyone who is symptomatic? 2) Do we have the ability to identify people who have been in contact with those who have tested positive to reduce further transmission? 3) Are older Californians and the medically vulnerable living in their own homes supported so they can continue to distance themselves? 4) Have we developed a plan to quickly identify and contain outbreaks in facilities housing older Californians, those living with disabilities, those currently incarcerated, and those with other health conditions? 5) Do we have adequate bed capacity, staff and supplies such as ventilators and masks? 6) Can our healthcare system adequately address COVID-19 and other critical healthcare needs? 7) Have we built a coalition of private, public and academic partners to accelerate the development of therapeutics? 8) Have we identified potential therapeutics that have shown promise? 9) Have we worked with businesses to support physical distancing practices and introducedguidelines to provide health checks when employees or the general public enter the premises? 10) Do we have supplies and equipment to keep the workforce and customers safe? 11) Are we tracking the right data to provide us an early warning system? 12) Do we have the ability to quickly communicate the need to reinstate these measures?

"Eight retiree neighbors got infected with coronavirus and three died in a matter of weeks while they kept playing their beloved daily game of poker where they would swap stories about their grandchildren. The spread of the virus among the longtime friends, aged in their 70s to 90s, can be traced back to the last game they played on March 12 in Florida - several days before the state issued a lockdown order and banned gatherings. The eight elderly retirees first met in South Florida casinos and formed a bond over their love of the game, before they started running their own game out ofan Aventura condominium. The group, who would travel on cruises together and saw each other as 'family', met to play poker five times a week for the last 10 years where they would play over pots of less than $100. But the March 12 game would turn out to be fatal. The group met as normal that day, hugging and passing round cards, cash and chips while they shared stories of their grandchildren. Just weeks after the game, three of their group have been killed and the other five infected with the killer virus. Marcy Friedman, 94, a former New York secretary who moved to Florida to retire, helped organize the decades-long weekly games held at 7 p.m. Sunday to Thursday. She developed breathing difficulties on March 15 and was hospitalized the following day. Ten days later she tested positive for coronavirus and died on March 28 atAventura Hospital. She had underlying heart, lung and kidney conditions. Her son Andrew Friedman told the Sun Sentinel that he had warned his mother to stop playing poker before the deadly game but she carried on because she loved playing with her best friends. 'It was her social life,' he said. He also pointed out that at the time of the game, the state of Florida did not seem to be concerned about an outbreak either. 'It wasn't like now,' he said. 'Everything wasn't shut down.' On March 12, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases was below 200 and social distancing rules were not in place. It was not until four days later on March 16 that President Trump issued guidance recommending gatherings be limited to just 10 people - something the group were still below the threshold of. Big casinos such as theThe Big Easy Casino and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood were still open for another week. As of April 15, Florida has 21,367 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 524 have died. Two of the other friendsBeverly Glass, 84, and Fred Sands, 86, a loving couple of 20 years who lived in Hollywood, also started showing symptoms of the virus within a week of the game. They were admitted into Memorial Regional Hospital and tested positive for coronavirus. Sands died on March 27 and Glass died on March 31. They were able to spend their last days together holding hands across their hospital beds. Glass' daughter Lori Helitzer told the Sentinel they were 'not a sit-at-home couple' but were 'movers and shakers' that regularly went to casinos around Florida. According to the Broward County Medical Examiner's Office, Sands had underlying conditions of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and tightening in the arteries and Glass had the same heart condition. Helitzer said she too had warned the lovebirds to stop playing and stay at home but that 'they didn't get it'. Harriet Molko, in her 70s, and her husband Ronald Molko, in his 80s, were also struck down with the deadly virus after the March 12 game. Harriet said she had stopped playing at casinos earlier in the month but continued playing the game with their longtime friends. Some of the group were still playing at The Big Easy Casino in Hallandale Beach and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood at the time, she said. Harriet began experiencing symptoms on March 15, tested positive on March 22 and was hospitalized for nine days. She made a full recovery and was released to her home in Miami on April 2 where she learned the news of her friends' deaths. 'It's just a nightmare and I'm trying to get over it,' she told the Sentinel. Ronald also tested positive but was not hospitalized. The couple do not have any pre-existing conditions. The three other friends, who have survived the virus, have not been named. Harriet Molko said that the state health department did contact one of the friends to try to carry out contact tracing but that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health departments in Florida have not reached out to the rest of them. 'I'm surprised they haven't called me yet,' Molko said. The tragic outbreak among the group is just one heartbreaking story of many where celebrations among families and friends have unwittingly spread the deadly virus and claimed several lives. A 40th birthday gathering in Connecticut was dubbed 'party zero' last month after guests became infected and spread coronavirus across several states and around the world. About 50 guests reportedly gathered on March 5 at a home in the wealthy suburb of Westport for a lavish buffet and celebration. After the event, roughly half of those at the party became infected with the disease, then transmitted it to other states and the rest of the world. According to the New York Times, guests left that evening for Johannesburg, New York City, other parts of Connecticut and the wider US. One of the guests was a 43-year-old South African businessman who started to feel ill during his flight home.He was later diagnosed with coronavirus. Three days after the party, one of the other guests woke up in Westport with chest pains, a fever that spiked to 104 degrees, and 'felt like she was dying'. Julie Endich wrote on Facebook in a lengthy post: 'My journey started on March 8, 3 days after I attended an event with amazing friends. 'I woke up that morning, with incredible chest pain, tightness and heaviness like someone was standing on my chest. 'As the day went on I started to get body aches, chills, fever and headache. It hit me fast. It felt like the flu x 2!!! I couldn't move, I was bedridden and my fevers were spiking to 104.' On the day of the partyConnecticut did not have a single recorded case of coronavirus, but as of today 10 people in the state have died with 415 infections. Meanwhile, a Chicago man with mild coronavirus symptoms is believed to have unintentionally been a 'super-spreader' triggering an outbreak that killed three people by going to a funeral, a birthday party, and a three-hour dinner. An investigation by theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand the Chicago Department of Public Health traced an outbreak inCook County, Illinois, which infected around 16 people from the age of 5 to 86 years old and killed three, to one man who infected others at a series of events. The man attended several familygatherings, including a birthday party, funeral and dinner, and these people then went on to infect others as they attended church services and visited relatives in the hospital, according to the report. The night before the funeral, patient zero shared a three-hour meal with two family members of the deceased. At the funeral service the following day, he hugged several people and took part in a potluck dinner. At least four of the people he is known to have hugged developed symptoms for coronavirus over the course of the next six days. One of the four became seriously ill and was hospitalized on a ventilator and died, the report states. Another person who was in close contact with the super-spreader at the funeral visited their sick relative with COVID-19 at the hospital and hugged them. This individual also developed symptoms three days later. A few days after the funeral, the index case then went to a birthday party with nine family members. At the party the group talked, hugged, and shared food for three hours. Within seven days of the party, seven attendees had been struck down with the virus. Two of them laterdied from the infection. Two people who cared for one of the dead victims - a home care worker and a family member - both went on to show symptoms of the virus. One individual who lived with the other victim alsodeveloped a cough. Three of the partygoers with less severe symptoms of the virus went to a church service six days after the event, where they sat in close contact with other churchgoers for a period of time andpassed the offering plate between them spreading the virus further again, according to the study. More than 27,000 Americans have now died from coronavirus with more than 633,000 infections.  "
"A chicken meat company in Delaware is being forced to kill up to two million chickens without selling the meat as a staff shortage caused by the coronavirus outbreak means there are not enough employees to process it for consumption. It comes amid growing concerns for the American food supply chain as processing plants are forced to close because of outbreaks, truckers express fears about traveling to hotspots and exporters grapple with a shortage of refrigerated containers. An outbreak among employees at a meat processing plant in South Dakota has now become the largest single-source cluster in the United States with 644 infections. In a letter sent to chicken growers on April 8, Allen Harim said its plant was now only at 50 percent of its normal operation because of continuously declining employee attendance because of illness and coronavirus concerns. They are now forced to depopulate chickens - an industry term for killing without sending to market - because they have too many birds than they can handle on their inventory. Allen Harim said in their April 8 letter that it has implemented measures to decrease the number of livestock it needs to process in the future by reducing the eggs and chicks placed with its chicken growers. The effects of this reduction will not be felt for another six weeks, however, and so the company said it had made the ‘difficult decision’ to ‘depopulate’ certain flocks on its growers farms in Delaware and Maryland. According to the Delmarva Poultry Industry, a trade association working with the meat chicken industry of which Allen Harim is a member, as many as 2million chickens could be killed within the depopulation ‘We are no longer able to harvest the amount of birds needed daily or weekly to maintain target weights and ages,’ said the letter, signed by the company’s Director of Live Operations Michele V. Minton. ‘When we started noticing the downward trend in attendance, we reduced the number of eggs set and chicks placed. ‘Unfortunately, reduced placement will not make an impact for another six weeks and with the continued attendance decline, and building bird inventory daily, we are forced to make a very difficult decision. ‘Starting Friday, April 10, we will begin depopulating flocks in the field. ‘Growers whose flocks we depopulate will be fairly compensated by Allen Harim.’ The company supplied no information on the flocks chosen or how the chickens would be killed, a point that peaked the attention of PETA. The animal rights organization addressed an open letter to the company about the manner in which the birds will be killed. 'These millions of chickens don’t deserve be tossed into an old wood chipper or struck with a two-by-four, as PETA has documented in other ""depopulation"" efforts,' said Daphna Nachminovitch, PETA’s senior vice president of cruelty investigations, in a press release that accompanied the letter. 'The law, veterinary guidance, and common decency all mandate that the chickens receive the quickest and least cruel death possible.' DailyMail.com contacted Allen Harim about the depopulation but a representative was not immediately available for comment. 'The impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. chicken industry is becoming more apparent as the disease continues to spread throughout the United States,' Delaware Poultry Industry Executive Director Holly Porter toldUSAToday. She added that the depopulation would use 'approved, humane methods – the same methods approved for depopulation in cases of infectious avian disease'. 'The methods used are accepted by the American Veterinary Medical Association and all state and local guidelines.' The news comes as experts in the meat industry claim that there will be a severe impact on the food supply chain as a result of coronavirus-related staff shortages and closures. Two other chicken meat producers have confirmed coronavirus cases among their staff - Mountaire Farms and Perdue Foods. Fears are mounting that the coronavirus pandemic could disrupt the American food supply chain, after outbreaks interrupted work at meat processing plants and truckers expressed fears of traveling to hotspots. The U.S. food supply chain is generally considered robust and well protected, with America producing enough domestically to feed its entire population. But disruptions in processing and distribution could cause temporary shortages of some items, or higher prices on grocery store shelves. On Monday, former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack said that a 'cascading series of events' is disrupting the US food supply chain in a way which could impact millions of Americans. It came as one of the country's largest pork processing facilities was closed down due to hundreds of their employees contracting coronavirus. Vilsack explained the extent of the supply chain disruptions in a CNN interview on Monday, warning that they will likely worsen as the pandemic rages on. 'You start ending school lunch programs, universities shut down, food service shuts down ... at the end of the day you've basically got a tremendous amount of the overall supply of food having to be redirected,' he said. '[This] is at a time when people are feeling a little bit of a pinch, in terms of the economy. Many unemployed people can't access the grocery store [or] go to a food bank. 'And now you have the cascading event of these facilities not having enough workers, or having sick workers, and having to shut down.' On Sunday, the CEO of Smithfield Foods also claimed the country's meat supply is at risk after the company was forced to close one of the country's largest pork processing facilities until further notice due to the coronavirus. The facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, closed as a number of its employees have fallen ill with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. According tothe Sioux Falls Argus Leader, the plant has now become the biggest single-source of cases in the United States. There are now518 Smithfield employees who have tested positive and 126 peoplethat became infected when they came into contact with an employee of the meat processor. It is the largest cluster in the country with 644 infections. The number of coronavirus infections in South Dakota has increased three-fold in a week to more than 1,000 but the state's Republican GovernorKristi Noem is still refusing to order a lockdown. South Dakota is among only five states in the country - all of which have Republican governors - that currently do not have lockdown orders in place. Despite the surge in cases, Gov. Noem - as recently as Wednesday - was standing firm on her decision not to issue a stay-at-home order for the state. Defending her decision earlier this month, Gov Noem suggested the lockdowns imposed on 95 percent of the country was 'herd mentality, not leadership'. 'South Dakota is not New York City,' she said. It comes after theSouth Dakota State Medical Association wrote a letter to Gov Noem on April 3 urging her to issue a quarantine order for residents. 'A stay-at-home order would give our health professionals the necessary time and resources to manage this pandemic,' the group said. More than 11 meat packing and processing plants have now been closed in North America because of the impact of coronavirus.. According to Smithfield, the plant accounts for 4 to 5 percent of the country's pork production. It supplies nearly 130 million servings of food per week, or about 18 million servings per day. 'The closure of this facility, combined with a growing list of other protein plants that have shuttered across our industry, is pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply,' the meat processor's CEO Kenneth Sullivan said in a statement on Sunday. 'It is impossible to keep our grocery stores stocked if our plants are not running. These facility closures will also have severe, perhaps disastrous, repercussions for many in the supply chain.' Sullivan said Smithfield had been operating during the coronavirus crisis because it wanted to sustain the nation's food supply. 'We believe it is our obligation to help feed the country, now more than ever. We have a stark choice as a nation: we are either going to produce food or not, even in the face of COVID-19,' he said. JBS USA shut a beef plant in Souderton, Pennsylvania, until April 16, after previously cutting production. JBS initially reduced production a beef plant in Greeley, Colorado, due to high absences among workers, according to the local United Food and Commercial Workers union. The plant is now closed after a further outbreak. At least three JBS workers have died of COVID-19 and four dozen others have tested positive for the virus Aurora Packing Company closed a beef plant in Aurora, Illinois, said Brad Lyle, chief financial officer for U.S. commodity firm Kerns and Associates. A security officer at the plant said it was closed due to the pandemic. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Harmony Beef in Alberta, Canada, shut its cattle slaughter operations on March 27 for two days, after a worker tested positive for the new coronavirus, prompting some federal inspectors to stay away from the site. Cargill Inc closed a plant in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, that produces meat for U.S. grocery stores. And its Fort Morgan, Colorado, meat packing plant is closed after suffering at least one death from coronavirus with six others testing positive Tyson Foods Inc shut a hog slaughterhouse in Columbus Junction, Iowa, the week of April 6 after more than 24 cases of COVID-19 involving employees at the facility. Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork processor, on Sunday said it is shutting a pork plant indefinitely and warned that plant shutdowns are pushing the United States 'perilously close to the edge' in meat supplies for grocers. The plant is now the source of the country's largest coronavirus cluster An Olymel pork plant in Yamachiche, Quebec, shut on March 29 for two weeks, after nine workers tested positive for the coronavirus. Maple Leaf Foods suspended operations on April 8 at its Brampton, Ontario poultry plant, following three COVID cases among workers at that facility. Sanderson Farms Inc reduced chicken production to 1 million birds a week from 1.3 million at a plant in Moultrie, Georgia. Smithfield announced a three-day closure last week so it could sanitize the plant and install physical barriers to enhance social distancing. But on Sunday, it announced the plant's indefinite closure. The plant employs 3,700 people who will now be out of work due to the plant's closure, and many of those employees have been infected with the virus. Of the roughly 430 active cases in South Dakota, about 240 of them are employees of the plant. Smithfield’s closure came just days after Tyson Foods was forced to suspend operations at a pork processing plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, after more than 24 employees there tested positive for coronavirus. 'In an effort to minimize the impact on our overall production, we're diverting the livestock supply originally scheduled for delivery to Columbus Junction to some of our other pork plants in the region,' Tyson CEO Noel White said in a statement. JBS USA, another major meat processor, stopped operations at its beef plant in Souderton, Pennsylvania due to sick employees there. The plant planned to reopen April 16 after two weeks. It has also closed its plant at Greeley, Colorado, and told all6,000 employees to self-quarantine. At least three JBS workers have died of COVID-19 and four dozen others have tested positive for the virus, according to NBC. Cargill has also paused operations at its protein plant in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, where 900 people typically work. And its Fort Morgan, Colorado, meat packing plant has suffered at least one death from coronavirus with six others testing positive, according to CBS. Meanwhile, other major meat processors are now coming up with contingency plans to respond to future outbreaks, as well as potential steps to prevent them from happening. Mississippi-based chicken processor Sanderson Farms, for example, is considering drastically streamlining its meat-packing methods so fewer workers are required on each shift. Under that plan, a reduced staff would package entire birds instead of going through the labor-intensive process of dividing chickens into cuts such as breasts, thighs and wings. Sanderson's Chief Financial Officer Mike Cockrell said that the company has already seen a spike in absences, but not at a level that would significantly disrupt operations. According to the Food and Drug Administration, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of coronavirus. Scientists also say that temperatures above 135 Fahrenheit quickly kill coronavirus, meaning any meat cooked according to instructions should be free of the pathogen. As farmers and food processors work to keep food available, the pandemic is also raising concerns about the distribution system, which relies heavily on truckers. Truck driver Josh Rickards, who owns a fleet of three tractor-trailers, told Yahoo Finance that the drivers who lease under his authority can't be convinced to take a job that requires them to travel to New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak. 'I mean, no one really wants to go there. Everyone's afraid of going there and being in a position where they actually contract the virus themselves,' Rickards said. In addition to the trucking problems, a sharp decline in air traffic has cut deeply into capacity to move fresh produce long distances. Andres Ocampo, chief executive of HLB Specialties LLC, a fruit importer based in Miami, Florida, relied on commercial flights to shift papayas and other produce from Brazil. Now he is buying more from Mexico and Guatemala, where goods can still be shipped by trucks. Ocampo says volumes of the company's imports from Brazil have dropped by 80 percent. U.S. and Canadian exporters are also grappling with a shortage of refrigerated containers to supply goods, as voyages of container ships from China to the West Coast are down by a quarter due to reduced demand because of lockdowns. 'The containers are tough to get right now,' said Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association, a U.S.-based trade group. 'If a company needs five containers, they'll find they can get one.' There are more 633,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States as of Wednesday. The death toll has reached 27,613."
"A man in Louisville, Kentucky shot his wife dead before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide as authorities say domestic violence is on the increase amid coronavirus lockdowns. John Wortman, 63, killed Rebekah, 60, on Friday night at their home in Jefferson County. Their bodies were discovered around 11.20pm and the coroner declared the husband died of a self-inflicted wound. A motive for the murder-suicide had not been reported. A former colleague of Rebekah remembered her as an 'amazing person'. 'She always had a smile on her face and was just happy,' Joni Lofton told the Courier Journal. 'She loved her family, friends and clients. She liked to be busy and was very crafty.' Lofton added to WDRB: 'She had so many sewing machines that would do embroidery, appliqué... She would give it as gifts.' The pair worked together at a tax preparation office for several years and she referred to her as 'Becky'. But Lofton said they hadn't been in frequent contact since they changed jobs. She was shocked about the deaths. 'I have no idea what on Earth could have been the cause of this,' Lofton said. 'I just feel numb.' A USA Today study recently found there was a 10 to 30 percent increase in domestic disturbance calls to police around the country, in 19 out of the 20 questioned. Louisville Police Department said that although statistics say domestic violence is on the rise, they haven't seen an increase in those calls. There may be a discrepancy after some police departments have warned in order to keep their officers and the community safe, they may not respond to some scenes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 'We have heard from several victims at the domestic violence intake center that they didn't call police because they thought we were not coming,' Lt. Shannon Lauder said. 'And that's so concerning for us. 'If you call 911, and you need help, we are still coming. We will be there for you.' The Center for Women and Families said there was an increase in contact about physical and emotional domestic matters. 'How do you stay safe in your own home when you have a perpetrator living in your home?' Elizabeth Wessels-Martin, CEO of the Center for Women and Families asked. 'And that's one of the things I don't think people were prepared for when we enforced this quarantine, what the dynamics would look like and the increase in violence.' As someone who has survived domestic abuse, she said about being confined to a home: 'It's like you're constantly walking on eggshells. It's almost hard to breathe.' She added: 'We are open just like we've always been,' Wessels-Martin echoed.' People can come to the center as a walk in, our crisis line is open, Greyhound is still running. So if folks need to relocate we will help them relocate. 'Get help. Get out. Save yourself. All it takes is one time.' Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said the city's aggravated assaults were up 10 percent in the last three weeks, and half of those were domestic violence, a significantly higher proportion than normal. Calls to Missouri's child abuse and neglect hotline dropped by half as the virus first struck the state. Advocates said the calls aren't made because the kids aren't in school. Another organization said children were suffering with domestic abuse during the pandemic too. 'And what we know about child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, is isolation helps keep that secret,' Pam Darnall, president and CO of the Family & Children's Place, told WDRB. 'So the more children are isolated from others the easier it is for that abuse to continue and to begin.'"
"Families of Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) staff who have died from the coronavirus will receive $500,000. The monetary amount was announced on Tuesday after it was reported that 59 MTA transit workers died from COVID-19. 'This is a first-in-the nation agreement that will protect and provide the families of those we have lost with substantial benefits, befitting the tragic loss they experienced,' MTA Chairman Pat Foye explained to Spectrum News. The funds were part of the line-of-duty death benefits that union leaders pressed MTA heads to provide. The benefits - part of the MTA labor contract - had been held up as the MTA wanted the federal government to pay. A negotiation was reached after several days. 'This COVID-19 death benefit is a recognition for the incredible contributions and sacrifices our workforce has made,' said John Samuelsen, president of the Transport Workers Union. The MTA is planning to cover the health insurance of spouses and their dependents for three years in addition to the lump $500,000 payment. Families will not be required to prove that the virus was contracted while the transit worker was on the job. 'I was tested positive, I have no idea how or when or under what circumstances I came in contact with the virus, we're not going to require that of our fallen colleagues,' Foye stated. The benefit is also not being made to try to prevent litigation from the families. 'We believe it's the right thing to do,' Foye said. All staff represented by subway, bus and commuter rail unions are covered in the deal. The MTA chairman is working with the board to approve benefits for non-union employees. To keep trains from getting too crowded, New York's MTA says it has sought to keep up normal service on the most-used routes. There are also police directing people on subway platforms to less crowded sections of trains. Riders are urged to cover their faces and to report situations where social distancing isn´t being observed. The agency has posted signs on some trains that read: 'Essential Worker, yes, ok to ride. ... No - why are you even reading this? Go home.' As of Tuesday, there were an additional 11,571 cases of the virus which brings the total across New York to 213,779. Deaths increased by 752 on Tuesday which brings the state's total to 11,586. That number however does not include the some 3,000 that were added to New York City's death toll because officials are now counting people who died without ever testing positive for COVID-19 but who medics fear had the virus."
"The family of a Houston man who leaped from a freeway overpass to avoid being struck by an Amazon Prime truck during a fatal chain-reaction crash say he's had to have both his legs amputated. Abdullah Baidas, 23, suffered multiple skull and spine fractures in the 15-foot jump on Friday from the Interstate 45 overpass north of downtown Houston, and his legs were so badly shattered on impact that they had to be surgically removed, Mahmoud Abuzaid, Baidas' uncle, told KTRK. Baidas is hospitalized under intensive care but is in stable condition, according to Abuzaid, who's been acting as a family spokesperson. Scroll down for video Two young children also were injured in the multi-vehicle crash, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. According to the sheriff's office, a red Lincoln Navigator hauling a trailer and carrying Anthony Alvarado, 22, a woman in her 20s and their children, ages 1 and 3, pulled over on the freeway at about 1.30am on Friday because of a flat tire. A grey Mazda crashed into the Lincoln from behind. The driver of the Mazda and the woman from the Lincoln got out and stood outside on the freeway, the sheriff's office said. A Chevy Silverado pickup truck operated by Tyler Vail, 29, swerved to avoid the vehicles, lost control and a crashed into a concrete dividing wall. Baidas, 23, was driving southbound when he noticed the wrecked vehicles and pulled over his white SUV to help the victims. Then, an 18-wheel tractor-trailer owned and operated by Amazon and JB Hunt Transport crashed into the vehicles, killing the driver of the Mazda and the woman from the Lincoln. The female victim's two children were restrained in their car seats in the rear and suffered minor injuries, the sheriff's office said. After jumping from the overpass, Baidas was able to call 911 and summon help. Roads were slick at the time of the crashes because of light rain. According to his Facebook profile, Baidas works as a mechanic and has a young daughter. On Wednesday, he shared an article about the crash on his social media page, writing in the caption: 'all I did was try to help.' In the wake of the crash, Baidas has hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit against Amazon, JB Hunt Transport and the driver of the tractor-trailer, 56-year-old Cody Munson, alleging multiple counts of negligence, negligent hiring and retention. Amazon released a statement addressing the deadly crash involving one of its trucks. 'This is a terrible incident and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with all involved,' the online retail giant stated. 'We will work with law enforcement and the carrier as they investigate.'"
"People with diabetes have a higher risk of dying if they catch coronavirus - this is due to an overproduction of immune cells in the lungs, a new study finds. Experts from Wuhan University found people with high blood glucose levels have a much greater chance of catching more severe strains of the deadly virus. The team say that COVID-19 increases glucose metabolism through a phenomenon known as a 'cytokine storm' that leads to too many immune cells being produced.  Dr Shi Liu, of Wuhan University in China, said this spike in immune cells often happen in the lungs and increases the risk of a diabetic coronavirus patient dying. Cytokines are the activating compounds of immune cells and when a patient is exposed to flu or coronavirus there is a dramatic spike in cytokine numbers. Glucose metabolism and inflammatory cytokine signal networks are known to have evolved together but it has not been clear whether they interact during flu infection. The finding published in Science Advances is based on experiments in mice. Lab rodents given glucosamine produced much higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than those that did not receive the sugar supplement. Additionally, the researchers analysed glucose levels in blood samples from patients diagnosed with flu and compared it to samples from healthy people. These were collected from volunteers during physical examinations at two Wuhan University hospitals between 2017 and 2019. This identified a chemical pathway which metabolises glucose as playing an essential role in cytokine storms triggered by the flu virus.  'Glucose serves as a major nutrient that fuels cellular metabolic activities. Glucose metabolism and ]inflammatory cytokine signal network evolved together,' said Liu. 'Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the two systems interact with each other during flu infection. 'In this study, we identified a previously undescribed mechanism of flu-regulated cytokine storm, in which flu induces cytokine storm by increasing glucose metabolism.' Cytokines are small proteins released by many different cells in the body, including those of the immune system where they coordinate the body's response against infection and trigger inflammation. Sometimes the body's response to infection can go into overdrive. For example, when SARS -CoV-2 – the virus behind the pandemic – enters the lungs, it triggers an immune response. This attracts immune cells to the region to attack the virus, resulting in localised inflammation. But in some patients, excessive or uncontrolled levels of cytokines are released which then activate more immune cells, resulting in hyperinflammation. This can seriously harm or even kill the patient and that is why people with diabetes have a much higher risk of dying from the virus. Cytokine has been increasingly recognised as a risk to health through the way it triggers inflammatory responses but it must be coupled to specific metabolic programs to support their energetic demands. 'Although more research is needed to understand the delicate regulatory mechanisms between flu-induced cytokine storm and glucose metabolism, our current findings may provide a potential target for the treatment of flu infection in the future,' said Liu. Cytokine storms are a common complication not only of Covid-19 and flu but of other respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. They are also associated with non-infectious diseases such as multiple sclerosis and pancreatitis. The phenomenon became more widely known after the 2005 outbreak of the avian H5N1 influenza virus, also known as 'bird flu', when the high fatality rate was linked to an out-of-control cytokine response. Cytokine storms might explain why some people have a severe reaction to coronaviruses while others only experience mild symptoms. They could also be the reason why younger people are less affected, as their immune systems are less developed and so produce lower levels of inflammation-driving cytokines. In 2006, six healthy young men were left in intensive care with multiple organ failure as a result of an out-of-control cytokine immune response during a preclinical trial of a new kind of drug. This reaction happened just 90 minutes after receiving a dose of the drug. The research has been published in the journal Science Advances. Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. There are two main types of diabetes: - Type 1, where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. - Type 2, where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin. Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. Reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes can be achieved through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight. The main symptoms of diabetes include: feeling very thirsty, urinating more frequently (particularly at night), feeling very tired, weight loss, and loss of muscle bulk. Source: NHS"
"Donald Trump proposed on a Saturday in early March that he begin hosting a talk radio show so Americans could pose direct questions to the president about the growing coronavirus outbreak – but he ditch the idea after realizing it would compete with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh's show. The show would not screen any of the calls, instead serving as an open line for concerned Americans to speak directly to the president about the coronavirus pandemic, three White House officials who heard the pitch told The New York Times. Trump's idea to start a White House talk radio show came before he announced a ban on European travel. He quickly outlined to those in the room, however, that he wouldn't go forward with the proposal since it would conflict with 'The Rush Limbaugh Show,' which he reiterated several times was the only reason he was against the idea. Two of the officials said no one present knew how to respond to Trump's idea – but one suggested hosting the show in the mornings or on weekends so the president's wouldn't be encroaching on Limbaugh's territory. But Trump insisted if he were hosting the show it would have to be for two hours every single day. Limbaugh is one of Trump's favorite media figures, rivaling even some of Fox News' most prominent favorites like Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. Sources told the Times that the president has come to appreciate Limbaugh even more during the coronavirus pandemic as he offers real-time reactions to how Trump's decisions play with his supporters. Trump invited Limbaugh as one of his guests to his State of the Union address earlier this year after the radio host was diagnosed with advanced stage lung cancer. At the annual event, Limbaugh sat next to first lady Melania Trump in the House gallery and was surprised during the event when he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which Melania personally donned around his neck. The conservatives show has been the most popular talk radio show in the country for decades – and Limbaugh currently draws an average of 15.5 million listeners a week. 'Rush is perfectly confident and competent to play the outsider to the system,' White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said, according to the Times. 'In that way, he and the president learn from each other.' Trump holds nearly-daily press briefings at the White House on the ever-developing coronavirus pandemic. The briefings sometimes span more than two hours, but there Trump and his coronavirus task force are only taking questions from reporters and not from the American people – and Trump wanted the ability to have a more direct-line of communication with supporters. An official involved in the conversation with the president that Saturday in early March said this wasn't the first time Trump has discussed starting a White House radio show. Despite dropping the proposal, Trump felt his best chance to communicate directly with the American people was through a radio show since there are no campaign rallies to look forward to with lockdowns, stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines in place. The president says he is aiming to reopen the country May 1."
"Millions of people's movements have dropped by as much as 87 percent in some parts of the US, as Americans stay at home amid state lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus. Teralytics has taken anonymized data on tens of millions of cellphone users' movements from a major telecom provider and analyzed it to track changes in movements since the pandemic first reared its head, according to Forbes. It excludes counties where there is data for less than 5 percent of the population. The interactive map shows how far fewer people are now out and about in the streets of the US Saturday April 11, with 40 percent fewer trips taken compared to Saturday March 7, before any state had gone into lockdown. On March 9, prior to lockdown, movement was only down 2 percent. By March 15 - prior to the first state-mandated lockdown on March 20 - people were already starting to limit their movements and stay home, with movement down 15 percent as numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases began to rise. Movement across the US was lowest on March 28, when Americans were in general 45 percent less on the go. As of April 11, movement had inched up slightly, with Americans making 40 percent fewer trips. The slight increase raises concerns that people will start relaxing social distancing practices as they want to return to normal life as soon as possible. In the crisis epicenter New York, where deaths increased by 752 Tuesday bringing the state todal to 11,586, movement has plummeted more than any other urban area. Movement was down a staggering 87 percent on Friday compared to Friday March 6. The usually thriving Big Apple has become a ghost town as all but essential businesses have shuttered and the residents have been told to stay home to help bring the pandemic under control. In northern Manhattan and parts of Queens and Brooklyn, daily trips are down by 60 to 70 percent, the map reveals. In California, the nation's most populous state as well as the first to order a lockdown on March 20, has also seen a sharp decline in movements among residents as people comply with social distancing and shutdown rules. The analysis shows that movement has been down 50 to 65 percent most days since March 17 in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. However, the map shows that the decline in movement has not been consistent across the nation, with some rural areas showing only slight drops and even increases in trip numbers. In a worrying trend, people are seen to be making more trips in rural areas and conservative states in the South and West. These area were typically slower to implement social distancing and lockdown rules, meaning people were on the back foot in reducing their movements. Alain Labrique, an epidemiologist and director at Johns Hopkins, warned that lack of enforcement of rules in rural areas and inconsistent messaging has left some residents ignoring potentially life-saving social distancing rules. 'There's still churches that are holding meetings, there are still stores that are open,' Labrique told Forbes. 'Until there's enforcement of these guidelines there will be places where they'll be poorly adhered to.' Fears are now mounting for rural areas as confirmed cases and deaths from the virus have begun to spike. The data also showed the change in movements in other hard-hit countries. While the US has shown a 40 percent overall decline in movement, movement in Italy has been down 67 percent. Italy, which was the deadliest country from the pandemic until Saturday when the US death toll soared past, has rolled out some of the strictest lockdown rules worldwide. A nationwide lockdown went into effect on March 10 restricting virtually all aspects of life and the military were drafted in to enforce orders for people to stay home. It has now began easing the lockdown rules. President Donald Trump has faced a backlash after he has repeatedly made promises to relax US shutdown rules so the economy can get up and running as soon as possible. On Tuesday, Trump was forced to backpedal on his claim thathe has 'total' and 'absolute' authority to end state stay-home orders - something that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pointed out contradicts the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which was incorporated into the Bill of Rights. The president said Mondaythat the power rested with him to reopen the country and said some states could even reopen before May 1 - which is the date his '30 Days to Slow the Spread' of the coronavirus ends. After facing a backlash, Trump said Tuesday he would leave the decision in the hands of the individual governors of each state. He also announced a list ofmore than 100 executives he plans to consult with on when to 'reopen' the US economy. The president touted a new task force to advise him on when to reopen the country, spanning several different industries. American Farm Bureau, Cisco systems, Midland Company, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley were just some of the names listed. Staying safe at home during the coronavirus pandemic is a luxury afforded the rich while low-income workers have no choice but to be out and about and travel to work, according to separate analysis of smartphone location data. Smartphone location data from Cuebig and analyzed by the New York Timesat the start of April showed a vast difference in movements between the rich and the poor. While the rich have holed up in their homes or even fled to their second homes in rural and beachside towns to hideout from the outbreak, poorer people across the US are continuing to move around despite lockdown rules and have an increased risk of catching the killer virus. This worrying trend lays bare the mounting evidence that the poorest in society are most at risk of being exposed to the deadly illness. Lower-income neighborhoods, such as Queens and the Bronx in New York City, have already been some of the hardest-hit areas by the outbreak. Wealthy people have been able to escape densely populated cities like New York to flee to their summer oasis in the Hamptons. They also have more job security and benefits. And, as the data suggests, they may also be in a position where they can stay at home more easily and practice social distancing. The data showed that people in all income groups are moving around less than they did before the outbreak, but richer people are staying home far more, especially during the working week. Across almost every US state, richer people also started limiting their movements days before the poor, meaning they had a headstart on social distancing practices before the pandemic escalated. In metro areas under stay-at-home orders which have the greatest difference in wealth between the richest and the poorest, the richest have almost halted movement completely. People in lower-income neighborhoods in these metro areas also drastically reduced their movement, but there was a renewed spike in movements after the third weekend of March - the start of the next workweek. In areas where the difference between the richest and poorest is less stark, both groups continued to move around. 'People want to talk about this virus as an equal opportunity pathogen, but it's really not,' Dr. Ashwin Vasan, a doctor and public health professor at Columbia University, told the Times. 'It's going right to the fissures in our society.' One reason for the disparity in movement is the types of jobs the richest and poorest in society hold. Many of the jobs classed as essential amid the pandemic are those often held by lower socioeconomic groups, such asgrocery store workers, care home workers, warehouse staff and delivery drivers. If they quit, they will often not be entitled to claim unemployment benefits. So these workers have no choice but to travel to work - and often on packed subways. 'The people at this income, they're either furloughed and not coming in to work, or they are essential construction, grocery cashiers, workers in long-term care institutions,' Matthew Rae, who directs a program on health care markets at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told the Times. In contrast, many high-income jobs are either non-essential or desk-based meaning wealthier workers are now either working from home or have been furloughed. 'Covid-19 is exposing a lot of the structural disadvantages that low-income people face,' including a lack of job security and uneven access to health care, said Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the essential work force, to the Times. 'The well-off are employed in industries where they are at a desk, and so there are some advantages built into these high-income neighborhoods during this pandemic.' Higher movement among the poorest could also be attributed to them visiting grocery stores regularly. The stockpiling frenzy is a luxury only afforded the rich. Lower-income households often live paycheck to paycheck and so cannot stump up the cash to bulk buy several weeks' worth of groceries and essential goods. Instead, they must make regular trips to stores - another possible reason for the greater movement and greater risk. The headstart on the virus among the richest has also put them at an advantage, said Dr. Vasan, the Columbia professor. He told The Times that just a few days can make a big difference to the spread, said Dr. Vasan, the Columbia professor:'It's just moving like wildfire through communities.' Vasan cautions that it is in the interest of both the rich and the poor to enable the poor to stay home. Pockets of people who are untested or who don't get the appropriate medical treatment can quickly become new clusters, he warned."
"At least 53 universities and colleges have announced that they will drop the ACT and SAT requirement for at least fall 2021 in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Due to COVID-19 states are on lockdown and students cannot gather for college admission exams that are often critical to get into the top schools in the nation. ACT Inc. and the College Board, which runs the ACT and SAT exams respectively, cancelled all exams through June, leading universities to bend their entry policies. Such schools include Boston University, which has adopted test-optional policies for fall 2021 through spring 2022 semesters. Even the University of California's school system, which released a report in February in favor of mandatory standardized testing, announced on March 31 it will suspend test requirements for its nine schools including UCLA and UC Berkeley for the fall 2021 cycle. The list of growing schools is compiled by the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a non-profit seeking to end the misuse of standardized testing. However, Ivy Leagues like Harvard and Yale still require test scores, as does Standford and other competitive West Coast Schools. Highly selective liberal arts colleges including Williams and Amherst in Massachusetts announced in the spring that tests would be optional for fall 2021 enrollment. Some schools are are prolonging the exception for even longer. Tufts University announced tests would be optional for a three-year period. Tulane University, all public Oregon universities, the University of Washington, Scripps College, Northeastern University and Texas Christian University made testing optional for fall 2021 or even longer. These schools join the over 1,080 schools that already abandoned the test requirement long before the coronavirus emerged. 'The health and safety of students is our first priority and we are collaborating with higher education institutions to provide flexibility to students and to support admissions under these unprecedented circumstances,' College Board spokesman Jerome White said, according to CNN. He said additional SAT dates will be added, 'as soon as the public health situation allows.' ACT Inc. Spokesman Ed Colby said that its scores will still be referenced in admissions and scholarship decisions, but schools are making 'temporary adjustments to theiradmission criteria to mitigate COVID-19 impact on applications and enrollment.' He reiterated that 'ACT remains committed to benefiting' students and schools alike. Student-run non-profit Student Voice is rallying for all colleges and universities to adopt test-optional policies for fall 2021 with a campaign called #TestOptionalNOW. 'There are many students across the country who no longer have access to test prep... their school's free test date... whose living situation has been changed and no longer have time to study for standardized tests. Those are the students that this test-optional campaign aims to help,'Maodon Tohouri, a junior at Amador Valley High School in California, said in a press conference on Monday. FairTest hopes that the temporary adjustment could influence the schools to adopt these policies permanently. 'This could well be the tipping point. Removal of the test was already rapidly increasing... From our experience, we've seen that when schools do these pilot programs, they never go back,'Bob Schaeffer, interim executive director of FairTest, said.

"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is set to release nearly 700 migrants who are at most risk of a coronavirus outbreak at their detention centers including immigrants who are elderly, preganant, or have underlying conditions. ICE said they also took into account the danger to the public and flight risk of the 693 detainees they were releasing. The decision comes on the heel of mounting pressure from Democrats and pro-immigrant groups who have demanded the mass liberation of more than 34,000 who are incarcerated and remain at risk of contracting the deadly coronavirus. Acting Deputy Homeland Security Director Ken Cuccinelli revealed on Tuesday that the agency had initially chosen a small group of160 people who are over the age of 60 or pregnant. ICE then conducted a study of the rest of its prison population and found that hundreds of others who suffered lung illness or other medical conditions also qualified to be released. 'As a special response to this particular crisis, ICE has instructed its field offices to further assess for the purpose of considering releases of certain individuals deemed to be at greater risk of exposure,'Cuccinelli told reporters, according to Fox News. 'ICE continues to reevaluate all individuals in custody who make up vulnerable populations and they've been modifying practices based on recommendations of the CDC.' The federal immigration enforcement agency is currently holding 33,800 people who unlawfully entered the United States, but more than half of the population have never been charged of a criminal offense or convicted of a crime. Though the Trump administration has effectively shut down new asylum claims during the pandemic, it's still holding people who were apprehended months or years earlier for civil violations, including over 5,800 people who passed government asylum screenings. Those who are eligible to be released will be subjected to several restrictions, including the use of a monitoring device. The ravaging illness has caused the death 26,059 people and sickened 609,696 in the United States. As of Sunday, ICE had reported that 77 detainees had tested positive for the coronavirus. The most recent case is that of a 40-year-old Mexican man who was being held at an ICE detention facility in Livingston, Texas. Nine leaders at evangelical Christian organizations urged the Trump administration to release people from immigration detention facilities 'who do not pose a threat to public safety' during the coronavirus pandemic, particularly those who are elderly or otherwise at higher risk for contracting COVID-19. In a letter dated Monday to Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the evangelicals called for alliances with religious and other local groups to help find released detainees 'safe accommodations in which to `shelter in place´ for as long as such practices are advised.' Such actions to aid social distancing in detention, the faith leaders wrote, would help staff as well as detained migrants. 'Our concern is rooted in our Christian belief that each human life is made in the image of God and thus precious, and, like you, we want to do everything possible to minimize the loss of life as a result of this pandemic,' the prominent evangelicals wrote. The evangelicals signing the letter said they would 'encourage the many churches and ministries within our networks to provide any assistance they can' to help released detainees shelter safely. The letter was signed by Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention; Walter Kim, president of the National Association of Evangelicals; and Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Council, among others. The signatories are senior members of the Evangelical Immigration Table, a group of Christian leaders who support comprehensive immigration reform. Rodriguez delivered a prayer at President Donald Trump's inauguration and has advised Trump on immigration, but has previously criticized some elements of the administration's immigration policy."
"More than 300 million Americans are under some kind of lockdown during to the coronavirus and are binge watching televisions shows and movies to pass the time. A new survey found that the average person is currently streaming eight hours of content per day and finishing three different television series every week. Along with viewing more content, the research shows that most homes have accounts for at least four different services with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime at the top of the list. And 75 percent have reported using streaming services more since stay at home orders were implemented over the past month. Scroll down for video Approximately 42 US states are currently under some type of stay at home order in a bid to limit the spread of the coronavirus. As of Wednesday, there are more than 588,000 cases and over 23,000 deaths have been confirmed in the country. Because Americans are stuck at home, they are turning to streaming services to fill their time. Tubi, a streaming service, conducted the survey that asked 2,000 people about their viewing habits during the coronavirus. 'The findings of the survey illuminate just how much people are turning to streaming as a way to stay entertained and cope with social isolation,' a Tubi spokesperson told Study Finds. 'Americans are binging more content than ever before, seeking free streaming options alongside subscription services, and turning to password sharing as a way to find more content,'. Not only are people spending more time on streaming services, but 65 percent of parents reported they are letting their children to watch more television and movies. Along with binging on new content, 56 percent of respondents said they are now rewatching shows they have seen before and starting them from the beginning. But three out of five people have watched the latest, most popular shows like Tiger King out of pressure from others – a third have also lied about viewing such content in order to go along with the crowd. Another study also took close look at how the coronavirus is impacting American's viewing activities. Conducted by ReelGood, another streaming service, the poll found similar results – more people are binge watching while under lockdown. However, the firm gathered more details which shows consumers are streaming more content while they work from home than compared to off-hours. Peak watching times were between 12 PM and 2 PM during the day, which is the middle of the workday for most Americans. Netflix has regained supreme among the streaming services and still holds the top spot during the coronavirus. However, Amazon Prime, Hulu and Disney+ were also found to be the most watched services.

"Babies who are breastfed in infancy carry fewer harmful viruses in their guts than those fed exclusively on bottle milk, a study claims. Scientists studied the first stools of 20 babies aged up to four days and a separate group of 124 babies aged between one and four months. Evidence from the faecal matter found even a mixed diet of breast and formula milk strongly inhibits the build-up of viral populations in the infant gut. Less than one in ten (nine per cent) of four-month-old babies given breast milk– or a combination of breast and bottle feeds – carried viruses. However,30 per cent of infants fed only on formula milk had viruses at this age. Scroll down for video The NHS guidance for getting your baby to latch onto your breast is as follows: Remember to support your baby's neck but not hold the back of their head. They should then be able to take a large mouthful of breast. Your nipple should go towards the roof of their mouth. Dr Frederic Bushman, who led the research from the University of Pennsylvania, says: 'These findings can help us better understand why some babies get sick and develop life-threatening infections in their first months of life. 'Breastfeeding is valuable in supporting infant health. Our data and other work suggests that some breastfeeding is better than no breastfeeding.' Researchers measured the numbers and types of viruses in the first stool - meconium - and subsequent stools of newborns in the United States and Botswana Genome sequencing and other virus-specific tools helped the scientists learn which viruses were present in the childrens' guts. Viruses found included those that can cause stomach complaints. At birth, babies had little or no signs of viral colonisation but by one month old, both bacteria and viruses could become well-established. Around one billion viruses were found per gram of gut contents, and the majority of the first wave werepredators that piggyback on the first bacteria. But by four months of age the viruses inside babies include those seen in adults and are able to replicate in human cells and have the capacity to cause illness. Breastfeeding is thought to suppress this process and protect the baby from infection, but researchers do not yet fully understand why. However, the study authors, writing inNature, said factors in breast milk likely to fight viruses include antibodies from the mother, sugars and proteins. Similar benefits for breastfeeding were observed in infants living in both the US and Botswana. However, four-month-old babies in the African country were more likely to have potentially-harmful viruses in their stools than US children. 'Location of the mom and baby seems to play a role, probably due to the kind and number of microorganisms babies are exposed to environmentally,' said Dr Guanxiang Liang, first author on the study. 'Nevertheless, Botswana-born babies still seemed to benefit from breastfeeding, whether exclusively or in addition to formula consumption.' The study suggests exclusive or partial breastfeeding protects babies from infection, including from viral gastroenteritis, which results in diarrhoea and vomiting. In the UK, rotavirus – a stomach bug which hits babies and young children – is the most common cause of gastroenteritis. Acute gastroenteritis is a leading cause of infant death around the world, killing 600,000 to 875,000 babies and children each year. UK health policy aims for every baby to be breastfed, if possible, up to the age of six months, but the rate currently falls far short of this. Between 46 and 48 per cent of mothers totally or partially breastfeed in England by the time their baby is six to eight weeks old,. Rates by the age of six months are much lower than in many other countries in Europe. Only 34 per cent of UK babies are receiving some breast milk at this age, compared with 49 per cent in the US and 71 per cent in Norway, a 2016 study found. Research has shown breastfed babies are less likely to be victims of sudden infant death syndrome, get leukaemia, become obese or suffer heart disease in adulthood. Experts say breastfeeding also offers health benefits for mothers, including helping to reduce the risk of breast cancer."
"Morgues are overflowing in a New York county where dozens of people are dying from coronavirus each day as officials look to store bodies in an unused meat processing plant. Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone described the crisis unfolding in his section of the Hamptons in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. 'We're seeing a total of 50, 60people dying a day from thevirus.All COVID-related,' Bellone said. 'The numbers are staggering.' A month ago, Suffolk County hadn't recorded a single coronavirus death. As of Tuesday, more than 653 people have died and 23,523 have been infected. Harrowing footage shows countless bodies lined up inside the county morgue and two refrigerated trucks, all of which are filled to capacity. County officials are now laying plans to convert a refrigerated building on the Suffolk County Farm into a temporary morgue as they expect the death toll to continue rising for the foreseeable future. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Bellone said the farm facility, which is owned by the county and run by the Cornell Cooperative Extension, is currently set up to hold 300 bodies but capacity could be increased to 450 if necessary. The county has also requested more body bags from the state as its current supply dwindles. 'I'm having conversations I never imagined having in this position,' Bellone told CNN. 'At the early stages of this crisis, we were having conversations about suggestions of using ice rinks and stores with refrigeration to store bodies. 'I made the decision that I was not going to tell families that we need to convert their children's ice-skating rinks and turn them into morgues because that is not who we are.' Suffolk County, which is home to 1.5 million people on the eastern half of Long Island, currently ranks fifth in New York state for coronavirus cases. 'If I can convey anything to people across the country who haven't been hit, it is how quick this happens and how intense it gets.And to do everything you can to prepare,' Bellone said. 'Once it does come, you're in for something you've never seen before.' According to the latest figures released Tuesday, more than 1,600 of Suffolk County's 23,523 infected individuals are currently hospitalized. The number of hospitalized patients increased by 22 from Tuesday to Wednesday as 196 were admitted and 174 were released. About a third of those hospitalized (562) are in the intensive care unit, an increase of 31 from Tuesday. Southside Hospital in Bay Shore is one of many health care facilities that are struggling to keep up with the unrelenting flood of critical-ill coronavirus patients in the past few weeks. The hospital increased its limited capacity from 305 beds to 418 beds before setting up a tent in the parking lot specifically for COVID-19 patients. 'We're maxed out. We have been maxed out for a while,' an ER worker told CNN. 'Everyone is talking about New York City, but our local community has had a widespread disease and we actually - within the health system - had a very high percentage of patients in the ICU.' Another worker said: 'Being an emergency room nurse, this is what you sign up for. You sign up to be there no matter what comes in the door. This is on a much bigger scale.' Exacerbating the crisis in Suffolk County and neighboring Nassau County is an influx of wealthy families fleeing New York City for Long Island's coveted beach towns to escape the coronavirus hotspot. Full-time residents of those towns have voiced concerns that the flood of so-called 'coronavirus refugees' would brought infection that much closer to their doorsteps while overwhelming already stretched resources. Late last month local leaders in four Hamptons communities wrote a letter to New York Governor Andrewurging him to ban the refugees from coming to Long Island. "
"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said yesterday he's 'not confident' the city can open for large public gatherings until after August meaning beaches could be empty this summer. 'We're going to take this very slow and carefully to make sure we get it right,' de Blasio told a news conference on Tuesday. 'I'm always going to first focus on how do we guarantee the health and safety of New Yorkers and make sure we don't take our foot off the gas too soon.' Earlier officials said 778 deaths were recorded statewide Monday, bringing New York's total to more than 10,800. That figure, though, did not factor in the thousands of probable deaths now being counted. A City Hall source claimed that de Blasio neither had the will nor the manpower to open up the beaches this summer. Speaking to the New York Post, the insider said: 'I am told they were given orders by OMB [the Office of Management and Budget] and City Hall to plan for scenarios including full and partial closures.' The official death toll from the coronavirus soared on Tuesdayafter NYC began counting people who probably had COVID-19, but died without ever being tested. Officials reported 3,778 'probable' deaths, where doctors were certain enough of the cause of death to list it on the death certificate, and 6,589 confirmed by a lab test. The source told the Post: 'Even if the mayor wants to open the beaches - which I don't think he's going to - they don't even have the manpower.They're having enormous difficulty hiring lifeguards right now.' Furthermore, de Blasio could be overruled by Governor Andrew Cuomo even if he did want to get the beaches open this summer.  Cuomo lashed President Donald Trump's claim of 'total' authority to reopen the nation's virus-stalled economy, saying yesterday he was talking more like a king than a president. The Democratic governor criticized Trump's assertion Monday that 'when somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total.' 'His proclamation is that he would be king, that's what a king is,' Cuomo said at his daily briefing. 'A king has total authority. That statement cannot stand.' The Republican president made his comments after Cuomo and governors on both coasts announced multi-state compacts to coordinate reopening society amid the global pandemic. Cuomo said restarting the economy must be done cautiously, or the hard-won gains of the past month could be quickly lost. In a tweet Tuesday, Trump appeared to liken the governors to mutinous crew members in the movie 'Mutiny on the Bounty.' Cuomo said the president was 'clearly unhappy.' But after taking aim at the president's comments Tuesday in multiple TV appearances and during his state Capitol briefing, Cuomo said he would not engage in a fight with him. 'The president is clearly spoiling for a fight on this issue,' Cuomo said. 'This is too important for anyone to play politics.' The change in the city's accounting of deaths came after officials acknowledged that statistics based only on laboratory-confirmed tests were failing to account for many people dying at home before they reached a hospital or even sought treatment. 'Behind every death is a friend, a family member, a loved one. We are focused on ensuring that every New Yorker who died because of COVID-19 gets counted,' said Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot. 'While these data reflect the tragic impact that the virus has had on our city, they will also help us to determine the scale and scope of the epidemic and guide us in our decisions.' But New Yorkers continue to die at an unnerving pace even as the number of patients in hospitals has levelled off."
"An Ohio woman who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and placed in a medically-induced coma still does not know that she gave birth to a baby boy last week. Megan Jeffries, a 27-year-old Celina-based nurse, gave birth to the newborn after doctors performed the emergency c-section on her, on April 9. 'She doesn't know that she had her baby, and her baby was delivered at 29 weeks,' her sister-in-law, Kacie Jeffries, explained to WDTN. Scroll down for video Megan was seven months pregnant when she first tested for the virus after slowly developing the normal symptoms associated with COVID-19. But her brother, Shaun Jeffries, says that in the span of'24 hours' time, the way it progressed, it was mean. That's the only way to put it: it was a mean virus.' Shaun said that his sister was very much aware of how dangerous the virus was. 'She was crying to my mom, saying she doesn't want to die,' he stated. 'That right there tells you she knew enough and what she was going through.' Her condition quickly grew worse, Kacie explained. She said: 'Her lungs were just failing. In order to save her and her baby, they had to do an emergency C-section.' The mother was sedated and put on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine (ECMO). The ECMO machine oxygenates the blood by pumping it out of the body, through an artificial lung, and then back in. 'By then they're saying that's the last thing. That's the last thing we can try and do,' Shaun shared Megan is now on a ventilator. Her premature baby boy have been tested for the virus twice and has tested negative each time. He remains inthe NICU. Her husband, Donny, was finally able to hold the baby three days after it was born.  'Never in a million years would we have thought our 27-year-old sister would be infected with this virus and almost lose her life. People have got to take this seriously.' The newborn has not been given a name as the family is hoping Megan will recover. "
"An Alabama woman seeking refuge from tornadoes that tore through the Deep South on Sunday claims that she and her family, including a young grandchild, were not allowed to enter a storm shelter because they were not wearing face masks. The resident of Crossville, Alabama, spoke about her harrowing experience to the station WHNT on condition of anonymity on Tuesday. At least 34 people were killed and numerous homes and businesses were destroyed in eight states as dozens of tornadoes roared through the region on Sunday and Monday amid the coronavirus pandemic. Scroll down for video In Alabama, two people were hurt and dozens of structures were damaged when a suspected EF2 tornado cut a destructive path through the city of Boaz in Marshall County. The Crossvile family were fleeing the Boaz twister on Sunday when they arrived at their local town shelter, only to be denied entry because they did not have enough face coverings for all three family members. 'The guy actually opened the door, he motioned, do you have a mask? I held up my mask. I said I have one mask, I can put it on the child. He motioned no and shut the door,' said the matriarch of the family, who was accompanied by her daughter and three-year-old grandchild. The woman said the shelter was not crowded, and she could have stayed six feet apart from other people. Officials with Dekalb County Emergency Management Agency told the station the family likely should have been allowed to stay in the shelter, but it is up to every individual municipality to make and enforce its own rules concerning coronavirus restrictions. Alabama governor Kay Ivey suspended social distancing rules, and some people wearing protective masks huddled closely together in storm shelters. Crossville Mayor Tera Fortenberry wrote a post on Facebook, warning residents about the face covering policy ahead of the storm. 'The storm shelter will OPEN Sunday April 12th at 11am— With the current COVID-19 Virus pandemic– Please try to remain calm and keep your distance as much as possible. YOU ARE ENTERING AT YOUR OWN RISK. Everyone has to wear a mask to be allowed to enter. (Homemade mask, medical masks or a bandana tied to cover your nose and mouth is acceptable).' The woman who was turned away from the shelter said she did not see the mayor's post. After being denied entry, the family of three got back in their car and took to the road in a pouring rain, with the tornado bearing down on the area. 'Actually twice trying to get somewhere, we nearly wrecked,' said the woman. "
"Oprah Winfrey has warned African Americans to take the coronavirusoutbreak seriously because it is 'ravaging our community' and 'taking us out'. The TV mogul said the coronavirus outbreak continued to have a devastating impact on black communities across the United States but that people weren't getting the message about the risk of asymptomatic carriers. Speaking to CBS This Morningon Tuesday, Winfrey said it was important for black people to understand that pre-existing conditions including diabetes and asthma put them at greater risk if they contracted the virus. She also voiced concerns for her own health, saying she was staying indoors because she suffered from pneumonia last year and that her 'lungs never really fully cleared'. 'It's not only ravaging our community, but people who have preexisting conditions, which I think people didn't hear that,' she said. 'So if you are taking medication for your diabetes, if you're taking medication because of hypertension, if you need an asthma inhaler for asthma, if you have any kind of lung disorder.' Winfrey revealed back in September that she had been taken to the emergency room witha serious case of pneumonia. 'So the moment I heard preexisting conditions, I'm like, ''lock the door, nobody coming in here',' Winfrey said. The disproportionate impacts of coronavirus on the African American community continue to be felt across the country. Some lawmakers and community leaders in cities hard-hit by the pandemic have been sounding the alarm over what they see as a disturbing trend of the virus killing African Americans at a higher rate. Among the cities where black residents have been hard-hit include Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans and Milwaukee. A history of systemic racism and inequity in access to health care and economic opportunity has made many African Americans far more vulnerable to the virus. Black adults suffer from higher rates of obesity, diabetes and asthma, which make them more susceptible, and also are more likely to be uninsured. They also often report that medical professionals take their ailments less seriously when they seek treatment. Many African Americans have service jobs such as bus drivers, pharmacy workers and grocery store employees, which have become essential during the lockdown. It prevents them from staying at home and expose them to the virus though contact with the public. Winfrey discussed the issue of the impact of the virus on black people, including during the latest installment of her 'Oprah Talks COVID-19' series, which is available for free on Apple TV+ starting on Tuesday. When she interviewed actor Idris Elba, who tested positive for the virus last month but showed no symptoms, Winfrey raised the problem of people spreading the virus without realizing they have it. 'It's all these people [asymptomatic carriers], who perhaps could be carriers,' she said. Earlier this month, Winfrey announced she is donating $10 million to support people and cities across the country during the pandemic. She will be committing $1 million to America's Food Fund, whose goal it is to make sure everyone has access to food.The fund was launched by Leonardo DiCaprio, Laurene Powell Jobs, Apple and the Ford Foundation. Winfrey's comments comeas theCenters for Disease Protection and Control faces increasing pressure to be more transparent about the toll of the virus on communities of color. The agency has not publicly reported racial or ethnic demographic data for COVID-19 tests performed across the country, though its own standardized form required for reporting COVID-19 tests and cases includes a section for indicating the race or ethnicity of those tested. Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday introduced legislation to compel federal health officials to post data daily that breaks down COVID-19 cases and deaths by race and ethnicity. The lawmakers say the demographic data is needed to address any disparities in the national response to the coronavirus outbreak. 'Because of government-sponsored discrimination and systemic racism, communities of color are on the frontlines of this pandemic,' Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of several sponsors of the legislation in the Senate, said in a statement. 'To effectively slow the spread of the virus and ensure our response is robust and equitable, we need comprehensive national data on who is getting infected, who is getting treatment, and who is dying.' In Chicago, 72 percent of the deaths have been black residents despite them only making up 30 percent of the city's population. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday that the coronavirus was 'devastating' African American communities. 'The answer that we believe is right is because of the underlying conditions that people of color and particularly black folks suffer from, whether it's diabetes, heart disease, upper respiratory illnesses, the kind of things that we've been talking about for a long time that plague black Chicago, that lead to life expectancy gaps,' Lightfoot said. 'This virus attacks those underlying conditions with a vengeance.' Last week, New York City released data that showed black and Latino people were twice as likely to die from coronavirus than white residents. In Louisiana, with New Orleans being a hot spot for the virus, about 70 per cent of those who have died were black. Black people only make up 32 per cent of residents in the state."
"The coronavirus pandemic has now infected more than two million people around the world, the latest figures revealed today. As of Wednesday morning there have been at least 2,004,670 cases of the disease, according to official sources. Experts believe that the true figure is much higher, with many people never tested because their symptoms are mild or because of a shortage of medical supplies. At least 130,680 people have died after catching the virus, more than half of them in Europe. The United States has the largest outbreak in the world with more than 600,000 confirmed cases and nearly 30,000 deaths. According to WHO figures, there were around 153,000 cases a month ago on March 15, but the figure had risen to 751,000 by March 31. The global tally passed one million on April 2, and has now doubled again in the space of two weeks. Billions of people are living under drastic lockdown measures which would have been unthinkable in most democracies until a few weeks ago. The people under quarantine include all of India's 1.3billion population as well as much of Europe. Schools, shops, restaurants and sports events have all been closed down in unprecedented measures to halt the spread of the disease, with the Olympic Games postponed for the first time since World War II. The crisis has also caused an economic standstill, prompting governments to promise billions and even trillions in rescue packages. There are also growing fears over outbreaks in developing countries, when even the rich world's health systems have been overwhelmed by the crisis. Many countries have faced shortages of protective equipment, leaving medics exposed to the virus and taking them out of service when they are urgently needed. China, where the outbreak began in late 2019, has officially recorded 82,295 cases and 3,342 deaths, although there is scepticism about the accuracy of its figures. China accounted for 99 per cent of global infections in February and still had a majority in mid-March, but now represents only four per cent of cases. The city of Wuhan where the outbreak was first reported finally ended its 76-day lockdown earlier this month. There were early hotspots in South Korea and Iran, but Europe and especially northern Italy became the epicentre of the disease in mid-March. Italy now has 162,488 cases of the disease, although Spain now has Europe's largest outbreak with 177,633 confirmed cases. In Britain, prime minister Boris Johnson became the most high-profile leader to be infected with the virus and was taken to intensive care before he eventually recovered. Some European countries have seen the epidemic lose pace and are now considering how to manage life after the lockdown. Scientists are scrambling to develop a vaccine which would turn the tide against the virus, but it is likely to be many months away at least. In addition, experts are still unsure exactly how the virus spreads and where it came from. In the meantime, many governments are looking at antibody tests, smartphone tracking apps and compulsory face masks as possible routes out of the shutdown. Antibody tests would show who is immune to the disease, possibly allowing them to bypass lockdown rules if there is no risk of them spreading the virus. However, governments have so far struggled to develop a reliable test. Smartphone apps could help authorities to contain an outbreak by identifying people who had been in contact with virus patients, although there are fears over privacy and surveillance. In the US, Donald Trump has pulled American funding from the World Health Organisation after accusing it of mishandling the pandemic. Trump said the $400million funds would be frozen pending a review into the WHO's role in 'severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus'. He accused the Geneva-based body of being biased towards China, saying it was putting 'political correctness above life-saving measures'. New York has taken the worst hit, suffering more than 10,000 deaths across the state - far more than on 9/11. Only a handful of remote places including Pacific islands and Antarctic research bases are known to be free of the disease. The secretive governments of North Korea and Turkmenistan also claim to have no cases, but their claims are regarded as highly doubtful."
"Dr.Anthony Fauci,the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the face of America's effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, believes pro sports can return in 2020, albeit with some major caveats such as empty stadiums and frequent screenings. 'There's a way of doing that,' Fauci said during an interview with Snapchat's Peter Hamby. 'Nobody comes to the stadium. Put [the players] in big hotels, wherever you want to play, keep them very well surveilled. ... Have them tested every single week and make sure they don't wind up infecting each other or their family, and just let them play the season out.' Similar suggestions have been debated both internally, among league officials and player representatives, and publicly, among fans and media. The NHL has considered relocating all 31 teams to a centralized location, such as Buffalo or the University of North Dakota, while the NBA has considered holding playoff games at a private gym in Las Vegas, and Major League Baseball has discussed starting its season at empty spring training facilities in the Phoenix area, as well as the Diamondbacks' home stadium. The NFL season has not been cancelled and commissioner Roger Goodell is hoping to play the entire 2020 campaign beginning this fall, although team facilities are currently shuttered amid the pandemic and the draft has been moved online after plans to hold the event in Las Vegas were cancelled. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he hopes to see sports return in the near future, adding that he is consulting on such plans with NBA commissioner Adam Silver, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, among others. Fauci's comments follow last week's release of a Seton Hall poll, showing that 72 percent of respondents would not attend games without a COVID-19 vaccine in circulation. Without social distancing or the existence of a vaccine, just 13 percent of respondents said they would attend sporting events as they had in the past. 'People say, ""Well you cant play without spectators,""' Fauci said. 'I think you'll probably get enough buy-in from people who are dying to see a baseball game, particularly me.' Fauci, who resides in Washington, said he's hoping to see the defending champion Nationals play this season. He is also known as a basketball fan, having previously given a web interview to Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry. Fauci, an immunologist, also played for New York's Regis High School before attending Holy Cross in 1958. On Tuesday, Arizona governor Doug Ducey said his state is willing to host all 30 major league teams at the time public health concerns allow, which eventually could lead to the start of the baseball season primarily in empty spring training ballparks. MLB and the players' association have had preliminary discussion of potential ways for the season to start if given the go-ahead by federal, state and local governments and health officials. Having all teams based in the Phoenix area is among the contingency plans being examined. There are 10 spring training parks plus the Diamondbacks' Chase Field, which has a retractable roof, and several college facilities. 'Arizona, at the right time, is very open minded to hosting whatever Major League Baseball would like from the state,' Ducey, a Republican, said Tuesday. 'At the time that it would be appropriate for public health, if Arizona were in a position to reopen, we have the facilities that are here.' 'We have the hotel space that is here,' he said. 'We all want to make certain that the metrics and the data are proper before we're able to go forward, but I think two words that would allow the country and the state of Arizona to know that things were headed back to normal would be: Play ball!' Ducey said he had spoken with Commissioner Rob Manfred about the all-Arizona option. 'There's a number of different scenarios,' the governor said. 'I think the first scenario that was talked about was the idea of these clubs coming, being in hotels and in a way, having their own stay-at-home orders whether it either be at the hotel, or inside the stadium, without fans. ... It's something that Arizona is open minded to, and I'm open minded to.' Another potential option is splitting teams between the two spring training leagues: Arizona's Cactus League and Florida's Grapefruit League. Arizona's advantage is that it has 10 spring training ballparks and Chase Field all within about 50 miles. Florida's spring training ballparks are spread by as much as 220 miles. Many players and staff are concerned about the potential of a long absence from family while sequestered. Minnesota catcher Mitch Garver wondered how the plan would work, 'Where do we live? Who's allowed to come with us? Are we only allowed to go to the field and back to the hotel? What kind of hotel? What kind of accommodations are we working with? Is there going to be meal money?' he said. 'Then you get into player health, and we're talking about playing in 120 degree weather on spring training fields potentially living out of a visiting locker room.'"
"A California mother says she feels 'violated' after discovering that a face mask company used one of her family photos in an advertisement that claimed they had died of COVID-19. The ad, created by the company FilterMax, features a photo of Sara Ancich alongside her husband and three children. It features a caption beneath the image which reads: 'Youngest son from a family of 5 is the sole survivor of a deadly pandemic after wearing a CDC approved filter'. 'Who would have the audacity to clearly not know a family and type that they had died?' an outraged Ancich asked in an interview with CBS News on Monday. The mom-of-three says she was first alerted to the ad by concerned friends who had seen it on Facebook. 'They were all reaching out saying, 'Is this true,' 'You haven't posted anything in a while,' 'Are you there,' 'Are you OK,'' Ancich stated. The bogus FilterMax ad claimed that the family members had contracted COVID-19 while attending a local church service. 'The family didn't wear any face masks which led them to be easily infected in that huge crowd,' the ad falsely claims. Ancich told CBS News that vulnerable people could clearly be duped by the ad - even though she and her family are very much alive and well. 'It's on the forefront of everybody's mind in the news and everything and how quickly it is taking lives. It could so, so clearly been true to people,' she stated. Ancich contacted Facebook and asked them to remove the ad from their site - however, it continued to pop up. 'It's violating.... I don't know how I could have prevented this,' she said. Ancich said the family photo was taken eight years ago, and must have been stolen off one of her social media accounts. The FilterMax ad also claimed that their products were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, the FDA told CBS News that there had been no such approval. CBS News contacted Facebook about the bogus advertisement, and the company immediately removed it from its site. Facebook has now 'banned all ads having to do with hand sanitizer, masks, wipes and COVID-19 tests'. Indeed, millions of anxious Facebook users may have been duped into believing the ad given the continuing global spread of COVID-19. Two million people across the world have now tested positive to the contagious virus, and 128,000 people have died. More than a quarter of COVID-19 cases are located in the United States. More than 615,000 Americans have tested positive to the disease, and 26,000 have died. "
"Hopes of eliminating the coronavirus were raised today after leading British experts revealed trials of a vaccine would begin on humans next week. Oxford University scientists are confident they can get jab for the incurable disease rolled out for millions to use by autumn. Tests of the experimental jab on different animals have shown promise - and the next step is to use it on humans to prove it is safe. The Oxford team are one of hundreds worldwide racing to develop a COVID-19 jab, which experts fear could take 18 months. More than 70 vaccines are currently in development, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Three different groups - one in China and two in the US - have already began trials on humans. Oxford's vaccine programme has already recruited 510 people, aged between 18 and 55, to take part in the first trial. They will receive either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine - which has been developed in Oxford - or a control injection for comparison. Professor Adrian Hill, who will lead the research, said: 'We are going into human trials next week. We have tested the vaccine in several different animal species. 'We have taken a fairly cautious approach, but a rapid one to assess the vaccine that we are developing.' Infected people can spread a contagion to others via direct or indirect exposure. An outbreak will continue to expand if the average number of people infected by each carrier is greater than one. SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES Prohibiting group gatherings, closing borders, advising people keep 1.5 metres apart, and confining people to their homes has been shown to halt the spread of coronavirus. In this method the public does not gain immunity in large numbers and the virus could re-surge dramatically if controls are lifted. HERD IMMUNITY People who recover from COVID-19 develop antibodies and immunity. As the virus spreads through the population and more people develop immunity there are less people the virus can infect. If enough people have immunity the outbreak will die away. It is estimated about 30 per cent of people who catch the virus will not show symptoms and for many more the symptoms will not be serious. This method produces a spike in infections which can overwhelm the healthcare system resulting in large numbers of fatalities. VACCINES A COVID-19 vaccine would be the safest and most effective way of controlling the outbreak. There are several vaccines currently in development though they need to be tested which can take many months. If a vaccine is rushed without proper testing there may be side-effects and complications. The team's vaccine comes from chimpanzees, who are injected with the coronavirus to produce antibodies that can be used to bolster the immune system of humans. It is hoped the vaccine, developed by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group clinical teams, will be ready in September. Speaking to the BBC World Service, Professor Hill explained they're trying to raise money to scale up the manufacturing of the vaccine. He said: 'We're a university, we have a very small in house manufacturing facility that can do dozens of doses. That's not good enough to supply the world, obviously. 'We are working with manufacturing organisations and paying them to start the process now. 'So by the time July, August, September comes - whenever this is looking good - we should have the vaccine to start deploying under emergency use recommendations. 'That's a different approval process to commercial supply, which often takes many more years.' Professor Hill added: 'There is no point in making a vaccine that you can't scale up and may only get 100,000 doses for after a huge amount of investment. 'You need a technology that allows you to make not millions but ideally billions of doses over a year.' The Oxford team last week announced hopes to have the vaccine ready for autumn, saying they were '80 per cent' confident it would work. Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology,admitted that this time frame was 'highly ambitious' many things could get in the way of that target. The drug industry is hoping to shorten the time it takes to get a vaccine to market – usually about 10 to 15 years – to within the next year. But public health officials say it will still take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine – despite human trials beginning. Britain's chief scientific adviser last month said that it would be at least 2021 before a vaccine was ready. Leading researchers have called for healthy volunteers to be purposely infected with the coronavirus to speed up the race. Drugs and vaccines tend to be tested in three stages before they get approved for human use. The first phase is a safety run. Phase two trials involve more people, and scientists will work out the correct dosage. They will also test the vaccine against a placebo. The final stage of testing is the real deal. It involves hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people across multiple sites for a long period of time. Three scientists, including Harvard's Professor Marc Lipsitch, last month suggested bypassing phase three to speed up the process. Rolling all phases into a controlled study has the potential to slash the wait time for the roll-out of an efficacious vaccine, the trio argued. Preclinical: Testing of drug on non-human subjects. Phase I: Studies that assess the safety of a drug or device. Usually includes a small number of healthy volunteers (20 to 100). Phase II: These test the efficacy of a drug or device.Most phase II studies are trials where one group of patients receives the experimental drug, while a second control group receives a standard treatment or placebo. Phase III: Randomized and blind testing in several hundred to several thousand patients, which can last several years. 70-90 per cent of drugs that enter Phase III successfully complete this phase. Once complete, a pharmaceutical company can request government approval for marketing the drug. Phase IV: Studies that are conducted after a drug or device has been approved for consumer sale. Source:WCG It was revealed yesterday that there are three leading vaccine candidates – one from China and two from companies in the US. Another 67 vaccines, developed by scientists worldwide including teams from the UK, are also working towards trials in humans. WHO's list - published at the weekend - comes as the global COVID-19 death count passed 100,000. The list shows Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, working with Hong Kong's CanSino Bio, are leading the charge with their vaccine, called Ad5-nCoV. In a listing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,CanSino Bio said itplans to move to phase II trials with the vaccine candidate in China 'soon'. Of the US-based drugs companies, Massachusetts-based Moderna got regulatory approval to move to human trials last month. Forty-five participants in Seattle received the experimental jab - developed with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - in March to test its safety. There is no chance participants could get infected from the shots, because they don’t contain the virus itself. Moderna took a different route to traditional vaccine techniques. Normally a weaker bug is planted in the body – like the MMR vaccine. But Moderna’s sees messenger RNA stimulate the immune system to make similar proteins to the killer virus, which it can then combat. Pennsylvania-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals began its human trials last week, in 40 healthy volunteeers in Philadelphia and Missouri. Inovio's approach is what's called a DNA vaccine, made using a section of the virus's genetic code packaged inside a piece of synthetic DNA."
"A leaked strategy devised by government officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revealed the government is lobbying to re-open parts of the US by May 1, beginning with schools and churches. The strategy, first obtained by the Washington Post, offers guidance to state and local governments as for how best to ease mitigation efforts and phase out restrictions, such as strict stay-at-home orders, to ensure safe re-openings.  The coalition task force has been working on the plan for the past week. Its contents have since been discussed by the White House's coronavirus task force as the Trump administration presses forward with its plans to get Americans out of their homes and back to work as soon as possible. Appearing to be an early draft, the document contains scant instructions for gradual re-openings of institutions such as churches, schools, child-care facilities, summer camps, national parks and restaurants. According to the Post, two anonymous administration officials said the president wants the plan finalized in the coming days in a bid to re-open 'low-risk' states by May 1. At a White House press briefing on Tuesday, the president hinted that plans to reopen the country were near to completion. Trump also explained he'shoping to speak with all 50 state governors 'shortly' in an effort to implement 'a very powerful reopening plan', with a specific date and time in mind for each state. 'We think we're going to be able to get them open very quickly,' Trump said of the some 20 states he credited as having managed to avoid the types of devastating outbreaks seen in the likes of New York and New Jersey. 'We will hold the governors accountable. But again, we’re going to be working with them to make sure it works very well,' Trump continued. Sources inside the White House told the Post the president has been so insistent on reopening the country quickly that they fear only a narrow window exists in which to provide information that will help to change his mind - and in turn help to stem the rising number of infections and deaths. Another source said the leaked document, dated April 10, contains only two parts of the coalition's eight-stage plan. The full plan contains three phases. The first of which is preparing the nation to reopen with a national communication campaign and community readiness campaign by May 1; phase two would run through May 15 and involve increasing the manufacturing of test kits and protective equipment, while boosting emergency funding; and finally phase three would see staged re-openings beginning on a case-by-case basis. According to FEMA and the CDC, the primary focus will be to 'reopen community settings where children are cared for, including K-12 schools, day cares, and locally attended summer camps, to allow the workforce to return to work. Other community settings will follow with careful monitoring for increased transmission that exceeds the public health and health care systems.' During the phased re-openings, the document emphasizes that it's critical to continue to strictly follow the hand-washing recommendations and the wearing of face-coverings in public, which are currently being instructed now. The experts, however, warn a '30-day shelter in place [order] followed by 180-day lifting of all mitigation results in large rebound curve — some level of mitigation will be needed until vaccines or broad community immunity is achieved for recovering communities,' the Post reported. Reopening communities in this way, the document theorizes, will 'entail a significant risk of resurgence of the virus.' As a result, any such plans for a reopening must meet four key criteria before being approved. Firstly, the incidence of infection must be considered 'genuinely low'; there must also be an effective monitoring system in place capable of detecting an increase in infection incidence; the public health system must be reacting robustly to all cases of COVID-19; and hospitals must have sufficient staffing and beds to deal with any sudden surge in cases. The plan also outlines conditions in which it would be reasonable to lift some mitigation measures, the phased steps required to do so, and indicators to help monitor the impact of transmission on public health and health system capacities. In communities with low mitigation measures in place, where the virus never significantly spread to, experts recommend those places can reopen soon. Moderate mitigation measures are recommend for former hot-spots undergoing 'controlled recovery', and significant mitigation is recommended in current or emerging hot spots. The document also shows recommendations for the CDC to form a COVID-19 Response Corps to assist state and local health departments with key public health functions, including hiring a squad of contact tracers who would be tasked with locating people who may have had contact with someone infected by the virus. The recommendation appears to be a response to calls from health experts who have, in the last week, urged state and federal officials to expand their capacity of contact tracers as local health departments currently lack the necessary resources to effectively identify people who've come into contact with infected patients. It also states that answers for 'app-based case and contact investigations will be necessary for augmenting the actions of public health workers and for greatly increasing the important role of slowing COVID-19 transmission in the community.' Google and Apple have already confirmed they're in the process of developing an app to track people's movements so that when they're confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, public health workers could go back and trace anyone the patient has come into contact with. However, the ethics of such software has raised a number of eyebrows with many considering the concept to pose a substantial encroachment on civil liberties."
"The Governor of Nairobi is sending coronavirus care packages filled with Hennessy cognac to the poor because he claims WHO advice says 'alcohol kills the virus.' Mike Sonko, wearing an ostentatious visor, said the parcels would contain miniatures of fine brandy at a typically flamboyant news conference from the Kenyan capital on Tuesday. 'We will be giving some small bottles of Hennessy in the food package which we give to our people,' Sonko decreed. 'I think from the research conducted by the World Health Organization and various health organisations it has been revealed that alcohol plays a very major role in killing the coronavirus or any sort of virus.' Sonko, who has been relieved of his duties pending a £2.7 million corruption trial, has been slammed by medical experts who said drinking alcohol is, in fact, detrimental to the immune system. Although the WHO do recommend the use of alcohol-based hand rubs to kill viruses, Hennessy - an 80 proof spirit - is not powerful enough to be applied in this way. The African Medical and Research Foundation (Amref) CEO Githinji Gitahi today rejected Sonko's cognac offering. He tweeted: 'Please completely ignore clowning of a major global pandemic taking lives and putting extreme pressure on households. 'Dump this the way you would dump your used COVID-19 mask-never to be recovered.' Gitahi also urged Kenya's Ministry of Health to condemn Sonko's comments in the strongest terms. In addition to Sonko's prescription of two ounce cognac miniatures worth £4 each, the care packages include genuine hand sanitizer, maize, nappies, cleaning products and other household basics. Although Kenya has only recorded 225 cases of coronavirus, including ten deaths, the disastrous impact it is having on the global markets is battering poorer country's the hardest, leading to hunger and desperation. On Saturday, the government banned unofficial direct distribution of food donations after a stampede at the Kibra District Office during a handout which left dozens injured the day before. But Sonko has continued to proudly display his donations on his Twitter feed and has urged the government to overturn their decision. He says that his NGO, the Sonko Rescue Team, has years of experience in such work in the community and ought to be allowed to continue. The governor has been barred from office since December as per his bail conditions ahead of his trial for allegedly embezzling £2.7 million (357 million Kenyan Shillings). Sonko denies the charges which he says are politically motivated. Sonko maintains he is the Governor of Nairobi on his Twitter feed and still appears to be playing an active role during the coronavirus pandemic, despite being forced to give up his powers to the federal government until his trial concludes. The maverick politician, whose self-given name 'Sonko' is slang in Swahili for a rich and flamboyant person, is renowned for his fine jewellery, including brilliant diamond rings and heavy gold chains. He has garnered a social media following for photos of his trips to the jewellers and throwing a Versace-themed 45th birthday party last month. Kenya has for decades battled the scourge of corruption, and President Uhuru Kenyatta - like many presidents before him - has vowed to combat graft. Dozens of top executives and government officials have been charged since Kenyatta's 2017 re-election, including sitting Finance Minister Henry Rotich who was in July charged over an alleged multi-million dollar corruption scandal."
"A woman whose father passed away from COVID-19 has shared heartbreaking details about the final hours of his life, revealing how she and her family said their goodbyes on the phone because they were unable to visit him in hospital. Abby Adair Reinhard, 41, from Rochester, New York, shared the devastating news about her father Donald's passing on Facebook last week, while also chronicling the two days that she spent on the phone with her dad and her siblings, as the 76-year-old remained unconscious in the hospital. 'My dad just died from COVID-19,' she began the post, which was shared on April 7. 'Here below is my chronicle of the last two days. Stay safe. Sending love.' The mother-of-three then proceeded to document the agony of the 48 hours leading up to her dad's death, sharing how she and her closest family members remained on the phone with him for much of that time, listening for his breathing and praying that he might make it through. Abby began her journal-style post on April 5, the day after her father tested positive for COVID-19 and was put into a medically-induced coma so he could be placed on a ventilator, having gone to the hospital for treatment after suffering a fall. She revealed that she had expected her father to be 'discharged soon' after going to the hospital, but that he tested positive for coronavirus while there 'before he had a chance'. 'The terror I’ve felt today is unlike anything I've ever experienced, and I can only imagine how hard it has been for you, Dad,' she wrote in the evening of April 5. 'I’m so sorry you are going through this nightmare. 'You went to the hospital after falling, and you were supposed to be discharged soon. But COVID spread, unsuspected, down the hall, before you had a chance.' Abby wrote of the 'fear' that her family felt when they learned that Donald had tested positive for the deadly illness, but said that she 'was able to regain a sense of calm' because her father's condition was 'encouraging'. On April 4, she said she went to bed 'hopeful' that he would pull through. However, the following day, Abby and her family received a devastating call from her father's doctors informing them that Donald's condition had worsened at that his diagnosis was 'dire'. 'This morning, I got the call and your dire prognosis. “Aspiration... deterioration... suffering... not much time,”' she wrote. 'Your lungs got ravaged so fast. I couldn’t fully take in what the nurse was saying — it didn't feel real.' Abby admits that her first reaction was to share her anger and frustration with the hospital worker, revealing that she asked how they are going to make sure 'this doesn't happen to other families', before questioning why they waited so long to wear masks - and why there wasn't more testing offered to patients. 'I caught myself and remembered that she was an innocent messenger working on the frontline of the pandemic, and I told her I was grateful for her,' she continued. It was when she realized that she wouldn't be able to be by her father's side when he died that Abby's 'felt a rush of fear and aguish', and broke down in tears. 'The weight of this reality hit hard, the dam broke, and I sobbed, realizing I couldn’t go to be by your side,' she wrote. Her father's nurse then offered to call the family from Donald's hospital phone and place it by his ear so that they could speak to him and hear him breathe during his final hours of life. Abby describes hearing her father 'struggling to breathe' and she spoke to him, telling him: 'I love you... Thank you... I’m sorry... I forgive you.' She writes of the helplessness she felt at being unable to help her father, or even ease his suffering, explaining that all she and her family could hear were the sounds of Donald struggling to breathe. 'Hearing the retching sound of your cough, I knew you were suffering -- and there I was, powerless, on the other end of the phone,' she wrote. 'But I was so thankful for the nurses. “Yes, Don, get that out,” they said. “You can do it, Don. That’s good.”' For the next few hours, Abby says her father 'settled down', and she began talking to him about some of her fondest memories, sharing stories about 'precious times at the lake' when Donald would play the guitar as the family gathered about a campfire. At one point, she sang some of their favorite campfire songs to him down the phone, while pacing back and forth in her bathroom. 'I clung to that image as if it were my saving grace,' Abby wrote. 'I hope you could hear through my tears as I sang our old campfire songs. '...I worked hard to breathe -- but not as hard as you.' Abby wrote that she will 'treasure' the time that she and her siblings spent on the phone with her father over the next few hours, recalling how Donald's four children - who are located in Dallas, Raleigh, Copenhagen, and Rochester - came together to share their fondest memories of him. During the call, the mom-of-three took breaks in order to speak to her father's doctors, writing that she 'needed opinions and data' because, as Donald's healthcare proxy, she would be the one to make a decision about his life support. 'I was unprepared for the decision I had to make,' she admitted, describing it as 'an unthinkable decision'. 'The doctors shared information and context, and it was clear that they were clear on the hard call I needed to make,' she wrote. 'But I did not have that same clarity. You always have been so strong, Dad, and I wanted to grasp on to any shred of hope.' After reading through her father's will and 'meditating on each life-and-death phrase', Abby says she reached 'the same answer as the doctors', admitting that she was devastated over the decision, but knew that it was the right one to make, particularly as her dad was suffering through every moment he was alive. 'So I made the horrifying but loving decision. ""Comfort care."" The doctor sounded relieved,' she said. Abby and her siblings remained on the phone with their father for much of the night, and she wrote of how 'connected' they felt as a family while sharing memories, despite being spread across the globe. Throughout much of the conversation, she said that the sound of her father's breathing served as a kind of. comfort for them all, 'background music to their call', but that each time his end of the line went silent, they were left in an 'excruciating' state of fear that he had passed away. 'When you don’t breathe, I hold my own breath, afraid it’s the end,' Abby said. 'And we all chime in, “Breathe, Dad -- we need to hear you breathe.” Then we finally hear you inhale. Then I let out a sigh of relief, grateful to know you're still with us. 'I have never loved and appreciated breath the way I love and appreciate breath right now.' On April 6, Abby explained that her father's condition had worsened, writing that his breath was 'more sporadic and thick', and the family spent much of the day listening for the sounds of his breathing. 'You just moaned softly, and I don’t know if you’re trying to say you love us, or if you’re in pain,' Abby wrote. 'We’re listening to you and loving you. I wish desperately we could be with you in person, and I hate picturing you in that room alone.' During the day, there were several gut-wrenching moments when Donald's end of the line went silent, and Abby recalled the painful shock that went through her every time - not knowing whether the 'dark, harrowing silence' meant that her father had passed, or whether the phone had simply slipped away from his ear. 'It’s been ten minutes since we last heard you, Dad,' she wrote. 'I know there's likely just an issue with the phone, but I'm really scared. But I keep thinking, if you were gone, surely by now the nurses would have come in, and we’d hear them through the phone. Right? Please...Dear God.' At one point, Abby's sister Carrie held her newborn baby Skylar up to the phone so she could hear her grandfather, and Abby shared her heartache over the idea that the two will never have the chance to meet. 'This is life, and this is death,' she noted. 'The newborn baby on the phone with the grandfather she’ll never meet.' By the evening, Abby admitted that she had started to question her decisions about her father's life support, writing that he had 'lasted much longer than the doctors predicted'. But after spending much of the day on the phone with their father, listening out for every breath and every sound, Abby and her three siblings decided to end the call and get some rest, noting that Donald would 'want them to take care of themselves'. 'I stayed muted on the line with you, as I tucked in the kids and got ready for bed,' she wrote. 'I journaled and fell asleep around 11. None of us hung up the line, in case we wanted to reconnect at any point during the night, but we agreed to step away from our phones and get some sleep.' Just after midnight, Abby received the call that her father had passed away shortly before the end of April 6. His cause of death was 'respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration and COVID-19'. The mother-of-three admits that she was wracked with guilt over ending the call with her dad just an hour before he died, writing: 'If I'd stayed on the phone just one more hour, I could have been with you. We'd been on the line together for almost 36 hours. What are the chances you would pass within an hour of our break? 'Maybe you didn’t want us to hear you go. Or maybe you didn’t have the space to leave while we were hanging on your every breath. If I’m honest, maybe part of me didn’t want to hear your last gasps of air.' Abby ended her Facebook post with a tribute to her father, describing him as a 'wonderful soul', while expressing her sense of disbelief that the tragedy that had befallen her family. 'I cannot believe this is happening,' she wrote. 'Dear God, thank you for welcoming my dad. He is such a good soul. 'Dad, I know we can still continue our conversation. Thank you so much. I love you forever. Love, Abby' My dad just died from COVID-19. Here below is my chronicle of the last two days. Stay safe. Sending love. April 5th, 2020, Evening: The terror I’ve felt today is unlike anything I've ever experienced, and I can only imagine how hard it has been for you, Dad. I’m so sorry you are going through this nightmare. You went to the hospital after falling, and you were supposed to be discharged soon. But COVID spread, unsuspected, down the hall, before you had a chance. On Saturday night I read that the test came back positive. I can’t describe the fear I felt in that moment, and I thought, “This cannot be happening to my family.” Somehow I was able to regain a sense of calm and went to bed hopeful, because the signs of your health were encouraging. This morning, I got the call and your dire prognosis. “Aspiration... deterioration... suffering... not much time.” Your lungs got ravaged so fast. I couldn’t fully take in what the nurse was saying — it didn't feel real. Then I heard myself say, ”How are you going to make sure this doesn’t happen to other families? Why did you all wait so long to wear masks, and why wasn’t there more testing? This never should have happened!” I caught myself and remembered that she was an innocent messenger working on the frontline of the pandemic, and I told her I was grateful for her. What was done was done. The weight of this reality hit hard, the dam broke, and I sobbed, realizing I couldn’t go to be by your side. No visitors. COVID wing. Oh my God. I felt a huge rush of fear and then anguish. But I couldn’t stay stuck there. I needed to talk to you, Dad, as soon as possible. The nurse offered to call me from your hospital phone and nestle it by your ear, so I could hear you breathe, and you could hear me talk. “I love you... Thank you... I’m sorry... I forgive you,” I said, as I heard you struggle to breathe and eject the ooze from your lungs. Hearing the retching sound of your cough, I knew you were suffering -- and there I was, powerless, on the other end of the phone. But I was so thankful for the nurses. “Yes, Don, get that out,” they said. “You can do it, Don. That’s good.” You settled down in between coughs, and I searched my heart for what to say. I hope you could hear me. I talked about our precious times at the lake. I remembered you playing your guitar around the campfire, and I clung to that image as if it were my saving grace. I hope you could hear through my tears as I sang our old campfire songs. Some of the lyrics seemed so fitting -- “Milk and honey on the other side” and “He’s got the whole world in his hands.” I paced back and forth in my bathroom, trying to contain my crying, as I attempted to get the words out. I worked hard to breathe -- but not as hard as you. After a half-hour or so, I realized I could join Tom, Carrie and Emily to the call. Over the next many hours, our conversation with you is one I will treasure for the rest of my life. Although we were each sitting in Dallas, Raleigh, Copenhagen or Rochester, we were together, unpacking memories we had stored away long ago. The lake, the Cape, and our Europe trip. Games, projects, and important conversations. We also sang more campfire songs. I pray that you could hear it all. I had to break away from the call a few times to talk to doctors. I needed opinions. I needed data. Until today I’d actually forgotten I was your health-care proxy, and I was unprepared for the decision I had to make. An unthinkable decision. The doctors shared information and context, and it was clear that they were clear on the hard call I needed to make. But I did not have that same clarity. You always have been so strong, Dad, and I wanted to grasp on to any shred of hope. I read your living will, over and over, meditating on each life-and-death phrase. I tried to put myself in your shoes. I also checked in with my intuition, which I've learned over the years is almost always right. The clear voice inside was leading me to the same answer as the doctors. I hated that answer, but I knew it was right and that I couldn’t wait too long, because you were suffering. So I made the horrifying but loving decision. ""Comfort care."" The doctor sounded relieved. Through all of this, I want you to know, Dad, that I haven’t had the feeling that it’s too much too bear. I’ve known deep down, that as hard as this is, I could handle it. And I’m eternally grateful to your sister Robin, who helped me sort out the right course of action. It’s now early evening, and I’ve been sitting at my desk writing while connected to our call. I’m glad to have documented what has happened up to this point. Now I’m trying to absorb this precious moment of being together virtually, giving thanks for you, Dad. It feels so good to laugh and cry. To be connected on the phone with you and my brother and sisters. To bring the images of us from earlier years back to life. It also feels good to hear you breathe. That rhythmic, white noise is the background music to our call. Although we’ve had a few excruciating periods of silence on your end -- maybe a minute long each time. When you don’t breathe, I hold my own breath, afraid it’s the end. And we all chime in, “Breathe, Dad -- we need to hear you breathe.” Then we finally hear you inhale. Then I let out a sigh of relief, grateful to know you're still with us. I have never loved and appreciated breath the way I love and appreciate breath right now. April 6th, Morning: Around midnight last night, I dozed off, with you still in my ear and all five phone lines connected. I don’t know how much sleep I got. Each nap was punctuated by our mantras, “We love you so much... We’re here for you… Your kids are all here, Dad.” Today your breath is more sporadic and thick, like you’re straining to suck paste up a straw. All I can do is listen on the other end of the phone, and write this down. My own chest is feeling tight now, as I imagine your lungs filling, while the virus seeps in. You just moaned softly, and I don’t know if you’re trying to say you love us, or if you’re in pain. We’re listening to you and loving you. I wish desperately we could be with you in person, and I hate picturing you in that room alone. But I keep coming back to my faith, which tells me you’re surrounded by love. I pray you can see angels behind your closed eyes. That you can feel their love -- and ours. That you can hear us on the other end of the phone. That you can sense the stirrings of your soul even while your body is becoming numb. April 6th, Afternoon: It’s been ten minutes since we last heard you, Dad. I know there's likely just an issue with the phone, but I'm really scared. But I keep thinking, if you were gone, surely by now the nurses would have come in, and we’d hear them through the phone. Right? Please...Dear God. You’re back! The phone had slipped. Thank you, God. Now we hear short, shallow breaths -- each one a miracle. You’re here. We’re here. With obvious relief, we're each telling you again how much we love you. Baby Skylar is hiccuping on Carrie’s line. This is life, and this is death. The newborn baby on the phone with the grandfather she’ll never meet. Then silence again. This one is a dark, harrowing silence... Ok, here come faint, short flicks of white noise. I hope that’s you. Yes, it’s louder now. It’s you! Thank God. I just said the Lord’s Prayer, in short bursts between my attempts at squelching my sobs so my kids can’t hear me. I feel the pressure of the wailing behind my eyes, as I whimper like a dog, and wipe the tears away. I feel it in my throat now too, the pressure. Grief is a strange thing. It comes in unpredictable waves. At one point earlier, I felt slightly guilty because I actually felt ok. And now here I am, pushing back against a huge wave of pain as it crests and I try to breathe through it. I’m breathing. You're breathing. We’re ok. ...I’m back and feeling much better. While it was silent on the phone, I breathed in and out when you did for about 15 or 20 breaths -- and it's all I focused on. A breathing duet and a meditation. I felt so connected to you, and my mind calmed more than ever today. Thank you. ...We’re all getting tired. The cadence of our conversation continues to slow. April 6th, Early Evening: The pain just hit hard again. I exhaled out a sob for so long and so hard, I felt my stomach muscles seize up. These are quiet wails, with just the hiss of air escaping my wide-open mouth. Now that I’m on the other side of that release, I’m feeling much more peaceful. This is lasting much longer than the doctor predicted yesterday. I start to question my decision until I speak with the with the new, kind doctor on the floor, who uses the phrase ""terminally ill."" Yesterday’s doctor is “off for the week” -- in quarantine, I assume. I also just read an article in the New York Times by an MD giving a gruesome account of intubation and the small chance of recovery it affords. I feel more at peace again with what's happening. I’m grateful Tom stopped telling you to keep fighting, Dad. But I grieve the loss of his hope -- the hope I played a part in taking away, with the decision Tom is so reluctant to accept. The first-born -- the only son. The one running for office, who needed his dad to last at least through November. His very proud father. Tom just stepped away from the call, and Carrie and Emily say, “I love you, Dad.” Silence again. I realize now that some of the silent patches on your end of the line are due to your faint breaths that aren’t loud enough to cue the phone line to pick you up. So the line sounds almost dead, as we wait and listen hard. I miss the in-and-out sound of your breaths, but the silence isn’t as scary now. I even manage to eat a slice of pizza. ...You’re back! We hear you, Dad. The phone line picked you back up thanks to background noise in the COVID wing, as the nurses opened your door to reposition you. They are superheroes, putting themselves at risk so you can be as comfortable as possible. We hear one of the nurses with a kind, lilting voice narrate as they move your body. Before leaving, she said, “Goodnight, Don. I’ll see you tomorrow.” I can't help but wonder if she’s right. I feel the need to sing to you again, so here goes, with “Our Love is Here to Stay.” A bit more upbeat than yesterday’s “Amazing Grace.” And just now I played “Country Road” from YouTube, so you could hear one of your favorite John Denver songs. ...You’re now making a new sound! A gentle, guttural sigh. Is this a new phase? Are you having a sweet dream? Are you seeing something? Now it’s gone silent again. How fleeting peace can be. I'm glad I reveled in it while it lasted. Now we wait, and listen, and pray again. The flavor of tonight’s call is so different than last night’s. Only a few stories. Our tired grief is slowing our brains and wearing on our spirits. The silence has been going on for several minutes now. But no nurses have come. Maybe the phone slipped again. Eight-year-old Caroline just popped in to my room asking if Grandpa Don sounded better. I told her honestly that you have been sounding much more calm. “Yes!” she said, with a huge smile. “There have been a lot of recoveries,” and, as her smile faded away, she added, “...and a lot of deaths.” I wonder how the coronavirus will shape my kids and their generation? I think now about what shaped you and your fellow Boomers. Vietnam....a war against communism in a distant land. Today it’s the coronavirus...a war waged against droplets in the air, all around us. I hear you breathing again, Dad. So grateful for that sound. Late Evening April 6th/Early Morning April 7th: The four of us just agreed we need more sleep tonight, and that you’d want us to take care of ourselves. It could be hours or days, and there’s no way to know. We couldn’t stay as connected on the phone as we were last night. I stayed muted on the line with you, as I tucked in the kids and got ready for bed. I journaled and fell asleep around 11. None of us hung up the line, in case we wanted to reconnect at any point during the night, but we agreed to step away from our phones and get some sleep. Then came the call, just after midnight. I knew what I was going to hear, and braced myself. Gone. You’re gone. Cause of death: “Respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration and COVID-19.” Time of death: 11:50 p.m. If I'd stayed on the phone just one more hour, I could have been with you. We'd been on the line together for almost 36 hours. What are the chances you would pass within an hour of our break? Maybe you didn’t want us to hear you go. Or maybe you didn’t have the space to leave while we were hanging on your every breath. If I’m honest, maybe part of me didn’t want to hear your last gasps of air. When I looked down at my phone, still connected to your hospital line, I wanted so badly to talk to you again, even though I knew you weren’t really there. I pictured your body lying on the bed and your spirit rising. “I love you, Dad,” I said into the phone. I paused for a few moments and pressed the red button to end the call. Here comes the pain again, so heavy. I cannot believe this is happening. Dear God,Thank you for welcoming my dad.He is such a good soul. Dad,I know we can still continue our conversation. Thank you so much. I love you forever. Love, Abby"
"America and Europe could be hit by up to four waves of coronavirus if it is allowed to ravage Africa, a WHO expert has warned. Director of the World Health Organisations's Center on Public Health and Human Rights,Professor Lawrence Gostin warned that if Covid-19 gets 'out of control' in African countries, Europe and the US could see second, third and even fourth waves of the illness. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday, Professor Gostin said:'Covid-19 is about to march through sub-Saharan Africa and perhaps the Indian subcontinent like an avalanche. 'Even if the United States and Europe were to get their Covid epidemics under control, if you've got Covid rages in other parts of the world, in this interconnected society we live in, it will come back to Europe and the United States. 'And in fact I could predict that if it gets out of control in these lower income countries that we will see in the US and Europe a second, and a third wave, and even a fourth wave of Covid. 'So we're truly only as safe as the weakest link in the global chain.' Commenting on Donald Trump's decision to freeze funding to the WHO, the professor predicted the move could have a 'devastating impact globally'. 'It's deeply concerning and dismaying that in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic, with tens of thousands of people dying across the world, to actually withdraw funding, or at least limit funding, to the World Health Organisation,' he said. Trump made the drastic decision to suspend funding to the WHO while an investigation into its handling of the pandemic is carried out. Trump singled out what he called the WHO's 'dangerous and costly decision' to argue against international travel bans to combat the pandemic. While praising his own decision to limit travel to and from China on January 31 - a month after the first cases of the disease were reported - Trump added: 'Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world. 'The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures.' The US is the largest single contributor to the WHO,paying in some $893million between 2018 and 2019 which made up around 15 per cent of the agency's total budget during that period. Virus cases among Africa's 1.3 billion people total more than 16,000, with 876 recorded deaths. Health experts say the continent is weeks behind the US and Europe in the pandemic and the rise in cases looks alarmingly similar to Europe's. As the world braces for potential waves of the virus, a joint appeal by European and African leaders says no region will be safe if Africa, with largely weak health systems, is left to fend for itself. Almost 20 European and African leaders have called for a massive international effort to boost Africa's coronavirus response, calling on the World Bank and IMF to help provide the continent the resources it needs to fight the virus. The IMF on Monday approved $500 million to cancel six months of debt payments for 25 of the world's most impoverished countries, including 19 African ones, so they can help tackle the pandemic. Such calls for assistance have been growing at the highest levels. In his Easter message, Pope Francis called for debt forgiveness for the world's poorest countries, saying they are being hardest hit by the pandemic and must not be 'abandoned.' African countries with coronavirus cases include: Algeria – 2,070 Angola – 19 Benin – 35 Botswana – 13 Burkina Faso – 528 Burundi – 5 Cameroon – 848 Cape Verde – 11 Central African Republic – 11 Chad – 23 Comoros – 0 Congo-Brazzaville – 74 DR Congo – 241 Djibouti – 363 Egypt – 2,350 Equatorial Guinea – 41 Eritrea – 35 Eswatini – 15 Ethiopia – 82 Gabon – 57 (The) Gambia – 9 Ghana – 636 Guinea – 363 Guinea-Bissau – 43 Ivory Coast – 638 Kenya – 216 Lesotho – 0 Liberia – 59 Libya – 35 Madagascar – 108 Malawi – 16 Mali – 144 Mauritania – 7 Mauritius – 324 Morocco – 1,888 Mozambique – 28 Namibia – 16 Niger – 570 Nigeria- 373 Rwanda – 134 Sao Tome and Principe – 4 Senegal – 299 Seychelles – 11 Sierra Leone – 11 Somalia – 60 South Africa – 2,415 South Sudan – 4 Sudan – 32 Tanzania – 53 Togo – 77 Tunisia – 747 Uganda – 55 Zambia – 45 Zimbabwe – 18 Source: Africa News  "
"Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott is insisting that a recent dinner he hosted had 'fewer than 10' guests rather than the 30 or so visitors who reportedly attended his party in defiance of Texas Governor Greg Abbott's shelter-in-place order amid the coronavirus outbreak. 'I understand and accept that there are additional responsibilities and media scrutiny that come with being an NFL quarterback, but it is very frustrating and disappointing when people provide completely inaccurate information from anonymous sources, especially now,' Prescott said in the statement. 'To set the record straight — I know that we all need to do our best to socially distance and like everyone else, I am continuing to adjust to what that requires, but the truth is that I was with fewer than 10 people for a home dinner — not a party — on Friday night.' That March 31 order, which will last until April 30, asked Texans to 'minimize social gatherings and minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household.' It superseded a previous order requiring that gatherings be limited to 10 people or less, narrowing the definition of what was deemed to be acceptable interactions during the pandemic. Abbott, himself, has avoided using the phrase 'shelter in place' to describe his March 31 order, but did clarify that he wants people to stay home unless they are needed for 'essential services and activities only.' Prescott's gathering, which was attended by Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott and recorded in a video that ultimately went viral, drew considerable criticism amid the worsening COVID-19 pandemic. Police were called to the scene, but were unable to verify the number of guests on hand, according to ESPN. 'I am very sensitive to the challenges we are all facing and making sure to support the first responders and medical personnel and everyone else putting in long hours,' read Prescott's statement. 'We are all at a time when we need to keep educating ourselves about the importance of health and isolation during this pandemic and I will continue to make sure to do my part by following the guidelines until we are approved to start returning to normal activities.' Video of the dinner party showed a full buffet, but it's unclear how many people attended. In one shot, a woman is seen eating in the foreground while Elliott and no fewer than four others can be seen in the background. Both Prescott and Elliott have had discussions about social distancing with the Cowboys front office, executive vice president Stephen Jones told Dallas sports radio station 105.3 The Fan. 'I think they're certainly aware now of how sensitive these situations are,' said Jones, the son of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. 'I don't think you'll be seeing that anymore. They're certainly guys we have the utmost respect for, and I certainly know they understand the sensitivity of the situation we're in today. It's certainly very serious and something that we know and certainly know they understand.' Prescott and Elliott have also been criticized on social media after former teammate Dez Bryant posted a picture from group workout on April 7 showing the participants arm-in-arm alongside each other. The NFL season has not been officially postponed because of the coronavirus, but the league has shuttered all team facilities and this month's draft will now be a virtual event after plans to hold it in Las Vegas were cancelled in March."
"The cyclist who was 'verbally attacked' byChris Cuomo has reported him to the cops and accused the CNN anchor of breaking quarantine rules laid out by his brother, New York Gov Andrew Cuomo. Chris Cuomo, who has tested positive for the coronavirus, ranted about his job on Monday during his SiriusXM show. He also told a story about being approached by a 'fat' biker who confronted him on Easter Sunday while he was out with his family near their home in the Hamptons. The man, who has only been identified as David, reportedly asked Cuomo's wife, Cristina, if he was properly quarantining while out riding his bike. David told the New York Post that Cristina came over to him and asked: 'May I help you?' David said he told her that he was just out riding his bike before asking her why Cuomo wasn't in quarantine. According to David, Cuomo was with Cristina, another woman and three kids. He claimed Cuomo then stormed over and asked: 'Who the hell are you? I can do what I want!' 'He just ranted, screaming, ""I'll find out who you are!"",' David said. 'I said to him, ""Your brother [Andrew Cuomo] is the coronavirus czar, and you're not even following his rules — unnecessary travel,""' David told the Post. David said he reported the incident to East Hampton cops on Monday afternoon. 'I hate bullies,' David said. He said he wanted to just get something on the record and has no plans to press charges unless he feels threatened. But Cuomo gave a completely different story during his rant on Monday. 'Here I am in an almost powerless position against this a**hole because I'm a celebrity and he's allowed to say whatever he wants to me.' The host said: 'I don't want some jackass, loser, fat tire biker being able to pull over and get in my space and talk bullsh** to me, I don't want to hear it. 'That matters to me more than making millions of dollars a year...because I've saved my money and I don't need it anymore. 'I want to be able to tell you to go to hell, to shut your mouth...I don't get that doing what I do for a living. 'Me being able to tell you to shut your mouth or I will do you the way you guys do each other.' During Cuomo's rant he also talked about his job at CNN,saying he was tired of interviewing disingenuous politicians and didn't 'value indulging irrationality, hyper-partisanship'. He also said: 'I don't like what I do professionally.I don't think it's worth my time.' The anchor said he no longer wants to be 'trafficking in things that I believe are ridiculous'. In particular, Cuomo said he found both Democrats and Republicans who went on his show said things they 'do not actually believe'. But on Tuesday, Cuomo backtracked his statements, saying:'I've never been in a better position professionally, I've never been more grateful, I've never been on a better team.' 'I love where I am. I love the position that I've been given. And I love who I'm doing it with.'"
"Denmark's children are back in the classroom as the country eases its month-long coronavirus restrictions - becoming the first in Europe to reopen schools. Nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools welcomed returning students today who were pictured lining up outside, six feet apart, to maintain social distance rules. Schools had been closed since March 12 in an effort to curb the the country's rising number of coronavirus cases. Around half of Denmark's municipalities and 35 percent of Copenhagen's schools are now reopening following an easing of measures fromMette Frederiksen, Denmark’s centre-left prime minister. Others have requested more time to adjust to health protocols still in place, though all are expected to reopen by April 20. In early April the country's government announced that schools would be reopened 'on the condition that everyone keeps their distance and washes their hands.' Special rules mean schools must ensure a distance of around six feet is maintained between desks in classrooms and breaks for students must only be organised for small groups at a time. Many schools are opting to teach outdoor classes in order to maintain the guidelines, which could pose a challenge for those in urban areas. In a press conference at the time, Frederiksen said: 'We are presenting a first, careful phase in the reopening of Denmark. It assumes that we are responsible and that the number of [of sick] are stable, not just for this week but for a long time to come.' Some parents have opposed the reopening of schools, citing health concerns. A petition dubbed 'My child is not a guinea pig' has had around 18,000 signatures. Henrik Wilhelmsen, principal of a school in the Norrebro district said they 'expect quite a lot of children to be kept at home'. Denmark's middle and high school-age students will continue to learn remotely. They are only expected to return to classrooms on May 10. Elisa Rimpler of the BUPL, the Danish Union of Early Childhood and Youth Educators, told the BBC: 'We're all a bit nervous and we'll have to ensure that we stick to hygiene rules. 'We have a lot of washing hands during the day. We don't have masks and we have to keep a good distance from each other so that's a very difficult task.' The next stage of Denmark's return to normality will be to consider allowing businesses like restaurants and hairdressers to reopen, though a ban on large public gatherings is likely to remain in place until August. Frederiksen said: 'I do not believe we will return to the Denmark we knew before coronavirus', adding that 'it is also important that we do not keep Denmark closed for longer than we need to'. The country has so far had nearly 6,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 299 deaths. And today Angela Merkel will follow Denmark's lead and discuss easing restrictions on shops and schools - despite a record spike in Covid-19 deaths. She will speak to leaders of Germany's 16 states today to discuss a possible easing in lockdown measures from April 20.  Before Denmark, Austria was the first European country to unveil its roadmap for a return to a 'new normal'. On Tuesday, it allowed small non-food shops to open up, while maintaining social distancing rules and requiring masks to be worn in shops and on public transport. Austria plans to keep schools, cafes and restaurants closed until at least mid-May."
"Germany will begin to cautiously ease its coronavirus restrictions, despite recording its deadliest day for Covid-19 related deaths, German Chancellor Angela Merkel confirmed today. Smaller shops are set to reopen next week after the coronavirus shutdown, while schools in early May. But Ms Merkel has warnedthat masks should be worn on public transport and in shops. 'It is recommended that masks be used in public transport and while shopping,' she told journalists after talks with regional leaders from Germany's 16 states. Following the much-anticipated talks today, Ms Merkel set out a plan for the first steps of a cautious restart of public life - following neighbouring Austria and Denmark and other countries in launching a slow loosening of restrictions. New infections in Germany have slowed in recent weeks, with the country having now recorded more 133,000 cases of coronavirus. There have been 3,254 coronavirus-related deaths in Germany, though 285 more deaths were recorded yesterday, the biggest daily spike the country has seen so far. But despite beginning to lift restrictions, Ms Merkel cautioned that the country has achieved only 'a fragile intermediate success' so far and does not have 'much room for manoeuvre.' She said a ban on gatherings of more than two people in public and an obligation to keep at a 1.5-metre distance from others, which has been in place since March 23, will remain in place. The measures were set to expire on Sunday. Nonessential shops, which have also have been closed for nearly four weeks, will be allowed to start reopening, with hygiene precautions, if they are up to 800 square metres in area. Car showrooms, bike shops and bookshops, irrespective of their size, will be allowed to open. Ms Merkel said the decisions apply to the period from Monday though May 3, and officials will review the situation again on April 30. Schools, which have been closed since mid-March, will begin to reopen step by step from May 4, with the oldest students returning first. Hairdressing salons also should prepare to reopen starting May 4, officials said. State governors and Germany's interior minister will hold talks this week with religious communities on what to do about religious gatherings, which have not been allowed in recent weeks, Ms Merkel said. It remains unclear when bars, cafes and restaurants - which also are closed, apart from for takeouts - will be allowed to reopen. 'We are moving forward in small steps and must see what effect they have,' Ms Merkel said. As reported earlier by the MailOnline, a panel of academics has advised Ms Merkel to re-open primary schools 'as soon as possible' as the number of infections loses pace. Germany had a setback today when 285 more deaths were added to the tally, the biggest daily spike so far. The 285 deaths - surpassing the previous record of 266 last Friday - bring the total from 2,969 to 3,254.  Experts warn that the time lag between infection and death means a country's death figures may continue to worsen even once the number of cases slows down. In addition, many countries have had inflated figures at the start of the week because of a weekend backlog, a problem which may have been exacerbated by the long Easter weekend. The number of new infections today was 2,486, higher than yesterday's 2,082 but still the second-lowest figure since March 22. The 2.0 per cent increase in cases brings the overall tally from 125,098 to 127,584. Germany also has a keen eye on the rate of contagion, known as R, which shows how quickly the virus is spreading. The rate is currently around 1.2, meaning that each person with the virus infects another 1.2 people on average. 'It is really in our interest that this R rate goes below 1, or is at 1. That is an important factor,' said Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch diseases institute. 'We can't speak of containment yet - we still have high numbers each day. We are seeing a slowdown,' he said. Today's changes come after Ms Merkel met the leaders of Germany's 16 states to discuss a possible way out of the lockdown. In recommendations sent to Ms Merkel, an influential group of academics called for schools to re-open 'as soon as possible'. The Academy of Sciences Leopoldina suggests that children could return to school in classes of no more than 15 at a time in order to enforce social distancing. Nicknamed the 'Merkel whisperers', the panel of experts have called for a 'gradual resumption of economic and social activity' as the epidemic eases. One proposal includes re-opening schools gradually from May 4 with priority given to primary and secondary pupils in final years. Schools must prepare a hygiene plan before they reopen their doors. Kindergartens and primary schools should re-open first because parents of younger children will benefit more from the resumption of daily childcare, the experts say. There would also have to be staggered break times so that the school playground does not become a breeding ground for the virus, they warn. Children should initially study a bare-bones curriculum of German, maths and foreign languages as schools make a gradual return to normality, they suggest. However, universities and other higher education institutions should stick to online teaching for the summer term, the experts advise. RKI chief Wieler said there were 'no major differences' between his view of the situation and the Academy's, apart from 'small details' such as which age groups should return to school first. 'There is still no blueprint' for how to reopen a society and economy after the virus lockdown, he added, and 'not always a right and wrong' answer. Merkel has said that the Academy's position paper will be important for her determination on the path forward. Germany has also closed shops, restaurants, playgrounds and sports facilities, and many companies have shut to aid the fight against the coronavirus. Berlin mayor Michael Mueller told broadcaster RBB yesterday that the lockdowns could be relaxed 'at the earliest from April 27, or possibly from May 1'. Much of the early decision-making was left to Germany's 16 states, of which Berlin is one. Federal economy minister Peter Altmaier declined to name a date for the relaxation of restrictions. 'The next few days will bring clarity,' he said on breakfast television, adding that the government was keenly aware of the risks of lifting restrictions too early only to have to impose a full lockdown later. 'If the impression arises that there is to-ing and fro-ing, it would damage trust in politics and harm the peoples' willingness to be disciplined and to cooperate,' Altmaier said. 'We have to consider every step.' Neighbouring Austria has already taken steps out of the lockdown, opening small shops yesterday with a view to opening larger ones on May 1. However, schools in Austria are set to remain closed until mid-May along with hotels and restaurants."
"Italy has seen its rate of coronavirus deaths and infections drop as the country's lockdown appears to be easing the crisis. Today saw an additional 578 deaths - bringing the total to 21,645 - compared to 602 on Tuesday, according to the Civil Protection Agency. The number of confirmed cases in Italy today rose by 2,667 - a sharp drop from daily increases of more than 6,000, which the country endured late last month. Italy has now seen a total of 165,155 infections. The country that was once the epicentre of European infections is now seeing the rate of infections and deaths stabilise, sparking authorities to reopen parts of the economy. Yesterday saw shoppers back on the streets in Austria and Italy as Europe takes its first cautious steps out of the coronavirus lockdown. Italy is opening a handful of stores including bookshops and stationery shops in a trial to see how social distancing measures can work after the lockdown, which otherwise remains in force. However, some regions have chosen not to take full advantage. Bookshops will not open for another week in Rome and will stay closed altogether in Lombardy. In Austria, which was the first European country to announce specific plans for ending the lockdown, shoppers were queuing outside hardware stores wearing compulsory masks as small shops re-opened today. Experts are not expecting a surge in customers, because some people will still be too worried to make unnecessary shopping trips and certain stores may choose to stay closed. Meanwhile, industrial and construction work is resuming in Spainwhere some workers were back at their jobs yesterday while other regions are returning today after an Easter Monday holiday. Some commuters in Spain said they felt reassured by the 10million masks which authorities are handing out this week. Elsewhere, Denmark is lining up a quicker-than-expected end to the lockdown after hospital cases continued to fall while Iceland says it will start easing restrictions next month. In Italy, most lockdown measures have been extended until May 3 but bookshops, stationery shops and stores selling children's clothes are allowed to re-open from today. The slightly loosened restrictions also include forestry and the wood industry on the list of permitted economic activities. Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte wants a wider economic restart 'as soon as possible' but the government says that 'the conditions are not yet in place'. Italy has been under a nationwide lockdown since March 9, longer than any other European country, and has seen the infection rate slow considerably in that time. There is also some disagreement among regions. The governor of Lombardy says bookshops in his hard-hit region will remain closed, but the leader of Liguria wants some construction sites to re-open, Italian media says. The Lazio region which includes Rome will delay the re-opening of bookshops until next week so that they can be cleaned, while Campania will open the children's clothes shops only two mornings a week. Piedmont, which includes Turin, is not loosening the lockdown at all, according to news agency ANSA."
"Spain saw its number of coronavirus cases shoot up by 5,092 today, putting an end to three days of slowing infections. The 5,092 new cases - up from 3,045 yesterday - mark the largest jump in six days and bring the total from 172,541 to 177,633. Many countries have seen higher figures at the start of a new week because of delays in counting weekend cases, a problem which may have been exacerbated by the long Easter weekend. Spain also reported 523 new deaths, down from yesterday's 567, taking the total from 18,056 to 18,579. Of the 5,092 new cases, the Madrid region accounted for 1,478 while Catalonia added another 1,308, according to official figures. The Spanish government says at least 114 of the new cases were really from the previous day in Andalucia. The increase of 5,092 brings a halt to a downward trend after jumps of 4,830 on Saturday, 4,167 on Sunday, 3,477 on Monday and 3,045 yesterday. Still, the average for the last week of 4,420 cases per day is far lower than the average 6,365 of the previous seven days. Since the beginning of March, Tuesdays and Wednesdays have typically seen an increase in daily infections while Sundays and Mondays have seen a fall. A similar phenomenon has been noted in other countries including Britain. In Spain, the average Tuesday update has been 914 cases worse than the one on Monday morning when weekend cases are still being counted. The Madrid region accounts for 6,724 of Spain's 18,579 deaths, while 3,756 people have died in Catalonia. The flattening curve has prompted the government to begin lifting lockdown restrictions this week, despite concern about a possible new surge in cases. Construction and manufacturing workers were allowed to resume their jobs on Monday after a two-week 'hibernation' of non-essential economic activity. However, police are still stopping motorists to check the reason for their journey in cities such as Barcelona. 'I still find it quite hasty, this return - I see too many people today,' hospital employee Monica Pinzon said at a Barcelona metro station. Police and the Red Cross are distributing millions of face masks to people at ticket barriers this week. For Roberto Aguayo, a 50-year-old Barcelona construction worker travelling on the metro, the restart of his sector came just in time. 'We really needed it. Just when we were going to run out of food, we returned to work,' he said. However, Catalan leader Quim Torra has described the decision to restart some industrial sectors as irresponsible. Torra said the lifting of restrictions created an 'enormous' risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections and a second lockdown. Unlike in other countries such as Britain, Spaniards are not allowed out of their houses for exercise and can only leave for essential activities like buying food. Shops, bars and public spaces will stay closed until at least April 26 in a lockdown which is feared to have cost at least 900,000 jobs already. The International Monetary Fund forecasts an eight per cent economic slump this year in Spain, to be followed by a recovery in 2021. Millions are turning to the government for relief. On Tuesday, the Spanish government approved a one-month tax moratorium for the self-employed and small companies. Authorities say the measures will allow those businesses to boost their short-term liquidity by around €3.6billion (£3.1billion). Meanwhile, social security has registered nearly a million requests from self-employed people for pay-outs under the terms of a state relief package announced last month, government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said."
"Iran has likely suffered twice as many deaths from coronavirus as the country's official death toll states, a parliamentary report has said. Investigators said the official total only counted those who died in hospital and who tested positive for the virus before they died - meaning the true toll is higher. Iran has officially reported 4,777 deaths from the virus - a figure which has caused suspicion among experts and the international community. The kingdom also reported 76,389 cases of the virus, making it the Middle East's worst outbreak by far. The 46-page report by Iran's parliament research center, published online, carries the weight of being written by nonpartisan experts within the country. Iranian health officials offered no comment on the report, released Tuesday. It represents the highest-level charge yet from within the Islamic Republic's government of its figures being questionable. The report comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani continues to push for a slow reopening of the country's economy, which remains under crushing U.S. sanctions. If its own figures offered to the World Health Organization are wrong, it adds to fears by some that encouraging people to return to work will spark a second wave of infections. 'In order to have more compatibility between protocol and estimated statistics, it is necessary to increase laboratory and testing capabilities in the country,' the report said. 'Needless to say that through increasing the capacities, diagnosis of disease will be more possible and spread of the disease will be more limited.' Already, hard-liners have seized on Rouhani's handling of the pandemic to criticize him and his administration, which is held in poor regard after his 2015 nuclear deal with world powers collapsed due to President Donald Trump's move that unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the accord. The explosive charge was merely a footnote on page 6 in what appeared to be an otherwise routine report. It said Health Ministry death toll figures counted only those who died in hospitals and had gotten positive test results for the virus. That disregarded all coronavirus victims who died in their homes. The report also said that aggressive testing, something experts have seized upon as necessary in the pandemic, has not been done in Iran - meaning other cases likely have been missed. It suggested the true death toll in Iran is probably 80% higher than figures now given, or nearly double. As far as the positive cases are involved, and given the undertesting, the number of people infected is probably 'eight to 10 times' higher than the reported figures, the report said. If correct, the report's worst-case figures would put Iran's death toll potential as high over 8,500, with some 760,000 total cases. That would catapult Iran to the country with the highest number of infections in the world. The U.S. has over 600,000 confirmed cases, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, though experts believe that number likely is larger as well. International experts long have suggested they suspected Iran's numbers as its mortality was higher than other nations. While other countriess also have seen cases spike, Iran's reported numbers so far have offered a gradual slope. The report also accused authorities of not providing its authors with 'detailed figures' over the disease. It also warned that more than 30,000 people could die if strict quarantine measures aren't taken. Last week, lawmaker Reza Shiran from the northeastern holy city of Mashhad, said that there had 'been no correct reporting on the death toll.' He alleged official reports instead labeled deaths as coming from an 'acute respiratory syndrome.' Deputy Health Minister Ali Reza Raisi on Wednesday acknowledged that the 'limits of testing' faced by Iran means it doesn't have accurate figures of all those infected. 'The real figures are more than the official statistics but it is not correct to multiply official figures by two or three,' he said, without elaborating or directly addressing the parliament report. Meanwhile, Dubai's long-haul carrier Emirates said Wednesday it has begun administering on-site rapid coronavirus tests for passengers, beginning with a flight to Tunisia. It described itself as the world's first airline to conduct on-site rapid tests for passengers. Dubai health officials conducted the blood test, offering results in 10 minutes, according to the airline. In Pakistan, officials said that the United Arab Emirates has released some 400 Pakistani prisoners convicted of minor crimes over the outbreak. A plane carrying 181 prisoners and eight Pakistani nationals stranded in Dubai landed in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Wednesday, immigration official Mohammad Zahid said. The 181 were quarantined, Zahid said, adding that the remaining prisoners will also return home soon. "
"Harry and Meghan have been forced to shelve plans to host a celebrity-filled birthday bash in Los Angeles for their son Archie, DailyMail.com can reveal. A source close to the couple said the pair had hoped to mix their son's first birthday on May 6 with a welcome to LA party - the perfect opportunity for the couple to mingle with family and friends. But the Duke and Duchess Of Sussex's plans have been scuppered after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were extended. On Friday Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the stay-at-home order would be extended through May 15 with all social gatherings still forbidden. Harry and Meghan will now opt for a quiet birthday celebration for Archie at their new Los Angeles home - the location of which remains a mystery. This comes after Harry's friend Dr Jane Goodall revealed the prince is finding life 'a bit challenging' following his move to California. The 86-year-old primatologist has 'been in touch' with Harry, 35, after he quit frontline royal duties to live in Canada and then Los Angeles with wife Meghan, 38, and baby Archie. Speaking to Radio Times, she said: 'I don't know how his career is going to map out, but, yes, I've been in touch – though I think he's finding life a bit challenging right now.' The Sussexes moved to California just before the US closed the border with Canada to non-residents last month. Meghan has purposely kept her mother Doria Ragland away from their LA home over concerns of spreading the coronavirus. And a business associate of the pair has told DailyMail.com that the couple has no intention of flouting the rules by throwing a big party for Archie's birthday. 'That is absolutely not going to happen now the authorities have extended the restrictions,' one associate told DailyMail.com. 'Los Angelenos have been told that social distancing remains a priority and parties or gatherings of any sort are out of the question. 'There is no way that Harry and Meghan could or would even consider throwing a party for family and friends. As special as Archie turning one is, now is the time to take safety more seriously than ever. 'Their close knit friend group will have plenty of other opportunities moving forward to come together. There are other events lined up throughout the rest of the year. 'It's a shame because Archie's birthday, without the lockdown, offered the perfect opportunity to host a welcome to LA bash for them and their friends. 'Just last week April 19 was the date restrictions would set to be lifted, but that's not the case any more for safety reasons.' Harry and Meghan have a long list of celebrity friends, many of which will have been on the invite list for the bash. They include James Corden, Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey, Idris Alba, Tom Hardy, Serena Williams, Elton John and George and Amal Clooney. Meghan's school friend Katherine McPhee, who lives in LA with Grammy winning music producer husband David Foster, will also have been invited, as well as her close friend Jessica Mulroney and former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer. The source added that while the lockdown is impacting many of Harry and Meghan's business and charity's plans, they are still in 'full planning mode'. 'They still hope to have Archewell up and running fully by the time the lockdown is lifted,' the associate said. 'Their desire to make their foundation a success is greater than ever. And what is happening to the world makes them more determined to do good in the world.' As of Tuesday Los Angeles County has recorded more than 9,400 coronavirus cases and more than 325 deaths. The city is under lockdown with only essential trips to supermarkets, pharmacies and exercise outings allowed. California has been one of the states hit the hardest by COVID-19, along with New York and Washington state, but recent numbers suggest social-distancing and other measures have helped slow the spread and flatten the curve. The Sussexes officially stepped down as senior working royals on March 31. They have set up home in Los Angeles after initially insisting they would settle in Canada. It's understood Meghan is hoping to eventually settle with her husband in the Malibu, Palisades and PCH corridor and is understood to be planning a return to show business. Earlier this month Disney announced the release of a charity film called Elephant which is narrated by Meghan."
"Princess Diana felt like a lamb to the slaughter on her wedding day to Prince Charles, former royal correspondent Jennie Bond has revealed. Speaking in Channel 5's documentary, Charles & Camilla: King and Queen in Waiting, which aired on Sunday, the former BBC royal reporter said Diana confined to her about her doubts on her big day. The documentary explored Prince Charles' early love life, his marriage to Princess Diana and his relationship with his second wife Camilla. It revealed how the Duchess of Cornwall went from being 'the most hated woman in Britain' after the infamous 'Camilla tapes' were leaked showing Charles relationship with her began while he was still married to Diana, to becoming loved by the public. Ms Bond, who grew close to Princess Diana while working as a royal correspondent from 1989 to 2003, revealed the fairytale appearance of the 1981 royal wedding was very different behind closed doors. She said: 'Diana told me much later in one of our private conversations that she had felt like a lamb to the slaughter as she walked up the aisle, which is very sad, but I think she knew that things weren't quite right. 'When she saw Camilla in the congregation she was immediately uneasy about it. Ms Bond added that Diana found a bracelet that Prince Charles given Camilla during their engagement, which he had engraved with her initials. 'She was enraged by it and she wanted to know why he had gifted this to Camilla'. Charles even wore a set of personalised cuff links, which read C & C, for Charles and Camilla, on the couple's honeymoon. Charles and Diana tied the knot in front at St Paul's Cathedral in front of 2,000 people on July 29, 1981. In 1992, Prime Minster John Major announced the couple were to separate, but continue living together at Kensington Palace. They divorced in 1996 and a year later Diana died in car crash in Paris. In 2005 he married Camilla Parker Bowles at Windsor Guildhall. The documentary also explains how Camilla went from being the most hated woman in Britain, to being loved by the public and the royal family, and being a mother figure to Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle by giving them advice when they joined the royal family. Victoria Howard, editor of the Crown Chronicles, explained that following his divorce to Diana, Charles lost favour with the public. 'No on would ever think of him as King. He was widely considered unfit to be the monarch of Britain,' she explained. The release of an intimate conservation between the couple, which was published while he was still married to Diana, was dubbed 'incredibly cruel' by the public and marked the beginning of the public's hatred toward Camilla, royal expertCarole Malone explained. Kate Nicholl, Vanity Fair's Royal Correspondent added that Camilla was spat at on the street and had bread pelted at her in supermarket aisles. But over many years, and a gradual easing into public life with the Prince of Wales, Camilla and Charles both ended up in the public's good graces again. Ms Nicholl also explained how Camilla became a rock for Meghan and Kate when they became engaged to her step-sons. 'In the run up to the royal wedding she took Kate out for lunch and gave her some step motherly advice. She has been there for the Duchess of Cambridge,' he said. Kate didn't know how to be royal, so she would have been an outsider, she was pursued by the press and Camilla knew how that felt' explained Ms Malone. 'In many ways, Camilla had paved the way for Meghan. Camilla would have been there to tell her not to take any criticism personally, but this is just what happens when you're an outsider' she added."
"Meghan Markle's high school sweetheart has been spotted in Los Angeles, as Meghan and Prince Harry are said to be looking for a home on her old crush's home turf, exclusive DailyMail.com photos show. Pictured for the first time ever, father-of-two Luis Segura was seen having lunch with a female friend and shopping for groceries before the city went into lockdown. The top real estate agent, 41, sells luxury homes in Pasadena, the suburb east of LA where Meghan, 38, and Harry, 35, were reportedly eyeing up properties. The royal couple are thought to have been looking at homes in the Los Angeles area for months before flying from their hideaway in Vancouver Island, Canada, to California towards the end of March before borders were closed. It has been claimed they are currently staying at a friend's home in Malibu and have scouted properties there and in other celebrity enclaves, such as Beverly Hills and Bel Air. But according to a report published in Vanity Fair last September, the couple also looked at possible future homes in Pasadena. The upmarket suburban city is known for its Rose Bowl stadium and is home to many cultural and scientific institutions and high quality private schools. It is not known whether they have consulted Luis and he remained tight-lipped when approached at his office in the city. Asked about his relationship with Meghan, he replied: 'I have no comment to make.' However, he is described on his company's website as a 'constant award winner, top producer and an active member of multiple charitable organizations'. A source told DailyMail.com: 'Luis is exactly the kind of person you would want in your corner if you were looking to buy property in Pasadena. 'He knows that market inside out and still has that sense of loyalty to Meghan not to speak about her to the press.' The source added: 'The fact that he is active on the charity scene would also be a big plus for Harry and Meghan, who have just announced the launch their new non-profit. 'In addition to that, Luis and Meghan have that personal history and were very close when they were growing up. He ticks all the boxes.' Despite the fevered coverage of Meghan's life and her romantic history, Luis has surprisingly remained under the radar. He currently lives a comfortable existence with Meghan-lookalike wife Christina – who runs her own beauty business – and their two sons. Last year, pictures surfaced of Meghan and Luis at joint Christmas balls for two Catholic schools in 1996 and 1997. Meghan was attending girls school Immaculate Heart in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles at the time while Luis was at all-boys St. Francis in La Cañada Flintridge. The future Duchess of Sussex can be seen beaming and wearing a long black dress as she cuddles up to Luis at the first ball held at the legendary Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Downtown LA. In the second photo she is wearing a low-cut spaghetti strap sequined slit dress, a choker and her hair in a stylish up-do as she poses with Luis in front of a Christmas tree. The following year Meghan took Luis' younger brother Danny to his high school prom after she was named homecoming queen. She also got Danny – who now works in theater – to audition for his first high school musical when he was 15. Our source said: 'Luis and Meghan were very into each during their time as high school sweethearts. It's fair to say Luis was madly in love with her. 'And she was very sweet to him, fun to be around and loved his family too, so the memories are good.' Last week Harry and Meghan announced their plans to launch a new non-profit named Archewell after the Greek word for 'source of action'. It comes after the couple were ordered to stop using the Sussex Royal brand after stepping down as senior royals."
"Princess Anne claimed younger royals are guilty of trying to 'reinvent the wheel' when it comes to their approach to royal duties. The Princess Royal, 69, toldVanity Fair royal correspondent Katie Nicholl that she is a 'fuddy-duddy' who puts value in the tried and tested approach to philanthropy, while members of the next generation, including Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, seem set on forging a new path. Anne does not refer to any royals in particular, but 2020 has already seen Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quit as working royals, as they prepare to launch a new charitable venture, Archewell, from the US. Speaking in the rare sit-down interview, Anne explained she spent 10 years putting in groundwork with Save The Children, one of her patronages, before she felt she had the understanding needed to take part in any public debates on behalf of the organisation. 'I don't think this younger generation probably understands what I was doing in the past and it's often true, isn't it?,' Princess Anne continued. 'You don't necessarily look at the previous generation and say, 'Oh, you did that?' Or, 'You went there?' Nowadays, they're much more looking for, 'Oh let's do it a new way.' 'And I'm already at the stage, 'Please do not reinvent that particular wheel. We've been there, done that. Some of these things don't work. You may need to go back to basics.'' This time spent on the ground with the organisation gave her a solid foundation on which she has continued to build. The Princess Royal now keeps a famously busy schedule. Last year she racked up more than 500 separate royal engagements. And the princess, who turns 70 in August, admitted she has no signs to retire. She pointed to the example of service set by her parents the Queen, 93, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 98.The Duke of Edinburgh retired in 2017, but the Queen, who turns 94 next week, still carried out nearly 300 official duties last year. 'I don't think retirement is quite the same [for me],' she said. 'Most people would say we're very lucky not to be in that situation because you wouldn't want to just stop. 'It is, to a large extent, the choice of the organizations you're involved with and whether they feel you're still relevant. 'But I think both my father and my mother have, quite rightly, made decisions about, you know, ""I can't spend enough time doing this and we need to find somebody else to do it"" because it makes sense. 'I have to admit they continued being there for a lot longer than I had in mind, but we'll see.' The interview took place on the same day that it was announced her son, Peter Phillips, was separating from his Canadian-born wife Autumn. While she didn't comment on the news, Anne did make clear how much she enjoys being a hands-on grandmother to their two daughters, Savannah and Isla, as well as the daughter Zara Tindall's two children, Mia and Lena.

"As thousands of brides around the world cancel their over-the-top ceremonies in favor of low-key weddings that are broadcast on Zoom, Meghan Markle's long-time makeup artist Daniel Martin has offered up his top tips for women who are having to do their own bridal beauty looks at home. The New York-based beauty pro, who was responsible for the Duchess of Sussex's wedding day makeup, revealed how brides can achieve a stunning, but natural-looking, glow for their wedding day amid the coronavirus pandemic, without the help of a professional artist. Speaking to Vogue.com, Martin also offered up expert advice on how brides can ensure that their makeup looks perfect in-person - as well as on camera, for all of those women who will be tying the knot while their loved ones watch the special moment via a livestream video. Drawing on the same technique that he used to prep Meghan for her wedding to Prince Harry, Martin shared that the key to perfecting any bridal beauty look is perfecting the skin before any makeup is applied. 'You want a little radiance, but you don’t want to be too shiny,' he said, explaining that the best way to achieve this is by using a blurring primer that will help to create the perfect blank canvas for your makeup. The next step, Martin said, is to tackle any redness, uneven tone, or blemishes by using a full-coverage concealer, which should be dotted on any areas that need some extra help - including around the sides of the nose, and on the under-eye area. According to the makeup expert, the key is to 'balance out your skin tone' in order to achieve the most natural, flawless look, with Martin warning brides: 'This isn't the time to show off your contour skills.' For any women who are concerned about their eye makeup abilities, Martin urges them to focus on their brows, saying that 'a nice brow finishes off the eye area' without the need to any over-the-top shadow or eyeliner. But before you start to fill in your brows with makeup, he advises that you make sure that they are shaped to your ideal specifications - and if you're not already comfortable using tweezers to perfect your own brows, Martin says it is 'time to learn real quick'. He advises using YouTube tutorials so you can go through the process step by step, before you move on to applying your products. As a first step, Martin revealed that he likes to use gel, which he brushes through the brows in the opposite direction to the hair growth in order to thicken up their appearance. Then, after the gel has dried, brush them back into place and fill in any holes with your product of choice, whether that is a pencil, a gel, or a pomade. This technique, Martin says, is the 'easiest way to get defined brows without them looking too Instagram-y'. Whether or not you are an expert with eye shadow or someone who tends to run in the opposite direction whenever they spot a palette, Meghan's makeup artist and friend says there is an easy trick to achieving a natural look that will still help your eyes to pop. He suggests just applying a 'wash of color or shimmer' onto the eyelid, explaining that this will help to 'open up the lid' and give your look a little something extra. Not sure what color to use? Try applying your preferred blusher or bronzer onto your lids with a fluffy brush, or even your finger. This will 'create a natural contour' and help to bring more 'harmony' to the face, Martin said. If you still don't feel confident adding any color to your lid, he says that a slick of waterproof mascara will add plenty of definition to the eye area - and should survive any wedding day tears. When it comes to perfecting the complexion, Martin says that, while you shouldn't go crazy with contour, blush is a must for any bride - just don't go crazy with the color or the application. A simple tip for achieving a natural flush is to start applying your product at the center of the cheek, directly under the pupil. He warns that you shouldn't bring the color too close to the nose, and instead sweep the product out from that center mark, bringing it back towards the ear. As far as the color is concerned, Martin says you can be pretty liberal with your choice - just make sure that it doesn't clash with your lipstick for the day. If you feel like your face needs a bit more color, you can add some bronzer - however Martin advises that you stick with a matte shade, and only apply it to areas where the sun would naturally hit the face. Finally, it's on to the finishing touches: a slick of neutral lipstick, and a spritz of setting spray to ensure your makeup lasts all as long as your wedding celebrations, whether they are taking place on Zoom, or in front of a crowd of millions, as Meghan's did. And, if you make any mistakes along the way, Martin urges brides to stay calm and simply start the process over again, rather than getting worked up while trying to fix your error. After all, 'the wedding is starting on your own time,' he points out. This is not the first time that the beauty guru has opened up about wedding day beauty - having already shared several of the secrets that went into perfecting the Duchess of Sussex's bridal makeup. In October, Martin appeared on British morning show Lorraine, when he detailed exactly how torecreate the former actress's signature glow in ten simple steps. He also revealed exactly what it was like on the 'incredible' morning of the day she tied the knot with Prince Harry, insisting that Meghan was completely relaxed and had 'so much fun' creating her wedding look. After his model had prepped her skin using her own individual skincare regime, Daniel began by applying foundation the size of '5 pence piece' and applying it with an eyeshadow brush from the middle of the face. He said: 'Whether i'm working with a Hollywood artist or doing a friends wedding makeup I like to keep things natural. 'First step is to prep the skin with your individual skincare regime. 'The first thing is your complexion, so I take size of 5p of foundation I use a small eye shadow brush. 'As we have a lot of redness in the middle of our face it's better to start here and blend out so you can gauge the coverage you're getting.' He then takes a sponge and blends the foundation with some concealer, which is applied underneath the eyes and on any blemishes on the face with his finger. He said: 'I like to go in with a sponge and blend out. 'Now I'm taking a little bit of concealer, I like to use my finger for concealer because it enables me to feel the face and where I need to cover it.' Next, he creates Meghan's signature dewy look by mixing together a liquid highlighter with more foundation and using the same brush to apply. He explained: 'So the next step is a fun step and that's adding a bit of radiance to the skin. 'For Meghan's wedding what I did was mixed the luminizer with foundation so it integrated the glow. 'I'm gonna use the same brush that I used and then I'm just gonna apply that.' Rounding off the skin look he used a neutral setting powder just on the T-zone to allow the 'radiance' from the highlight to still shine through. He revealed: 'I just really concentrated the powder right in your T-zone because I really want this radiance to come through.' For the eyes, Daniel uses his finger to apply a dark brown eyeshadow as a base followed by a lighter shadow in the corner of the eyes. He told: 'I'm going to use my finger and a brush so i'm gonna take this aubergine warm brown. 'Laying down with the brush really helps give you that form, and then I'm just gonna pop a little bit of light into the inner corners of your eye.' He went on to use a flat brush to addmascara and 'always starts at the base' - he then finishes off the eyes by applying liquid eyeliner to the bottom of the lashes, just to 'adda bit of drama.' To finish the look he shapes the face using a light bronzer and adds a high-pigment gloss for the lips. When quizzed on the special day, he revealed that how 'easy' it was to spend time with the royal and her mother. He said: 'What I do remember was how much fun it was and how easy it was just to be with your friend and her mum and get her ready on such an incredible day. 'I don't think she was nervous because we weren't nervous it was very, very chilled .'"
"A female Alabama police detective has been charged with capital murder after allegedly killing a woman as part of a 'love triangle' dispute with her male colleague. Birmingham police Detective Alfreda Fluker, 39, was formally charged with murder on Tuesday in the Friday killing of Kanisha Fuller. She was also charged with the attempted murder of Detective Mario Theodore White, her coworker on the Birmingham Police Department's Crime Reduction Team. Officers responding to a reported shooting at Birmingham's Germania Park at around 11.15pm found Fuller, 43, inside White's unmarked police car suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, including at least one to the head.  She was taken to UAB Hospital's Trauma Center where she was pronounced dead early Saturday. White was there too, but he wasn't wounded. There is no indication he called 911 following the shooting, authorities said. He was off duty at the time of the incident. 'This is not a press conference that I wanted to give today or any other day, but it's about the facts and the realities of life,'' Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith said on Saturday morning, as Al.com reported. Investigators determined Fluker was the shooter and she was arrested at 7am on Saturday at her home in west Birmingham. She is a 15-year veteran of the department.   Smith said he didn't know the exact relationship between White, Fluker and Fuller but said both women at one point were in a relationship with White. 'It's something that's been going on for a little while,' he said, 'but without our knowledge.' White is currently on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. 'We followed every protocol to make sure we were doing everything the right way and even it when it leads to one of our own, we're going to make the tough call and take the right actions,' Smith said. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency's State Bureau of Investigation is now in charge of the investigation of the case. 'Today has been a very difficult day for the Birmingham Police Department as we've investigated and watched this tragic event unfold and three lives have been forever changed,'' the department said in a statement. 'Our thoughts, prayers and condolences go out to the victim and her family.' According to social media posts, Fuller lived in Bessemer with her teenage son. "
"Jussie Smollett had a sexual relationship with one of the Nigerian brothers who allegedly orchestrated his 'hoax' attack, a new source claims. The anonymous insider told Page Six Wednesday that the Empire star, 37, and his purported 'attacker' Abel Osundairo also visited an upscale Chicago bathhouse together on multiple occasions. 'They used to party together and he [Smollet] had a sexual relationship with [Osundairo]. They went to this affluent Chicago bathhouse multiple times and they had to show ID. It's known as a bathhouse where a lot of affluent black gay men hang out,' the source stated. The insider further claimed that there is likely to be records of the pair's visits to the establishment, and says they could be seized as part of Smollet's upcoming trial on felony disorder conduct charges. Smollet says he was attacked by two masked men in Chicago back in January 2019. He claims they poured bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck and shouted racist and homophobic slurs. An investigation later led police to Abel Osundairo and his brother, Ola, who allege that Smollet paid them $3,500 to stage the attack in a bid to boost his public profile. Ola Osundairo is a personal trainer who appeared in an episode of Empire. Smollet and Ola reportedly became friendly and traded 'workout tips' via text message. Smollet was subsequently charged with lying to police before the case was later dropped. However, Smollet was indicted again in February of this year following an investigation by a special prosecutor. Abel and Ola Osundairo - who originally hail from Nigeria - have dismissed insinuations that they are gay. Smollet's lawyers, Tina Glandian and Mark Geragos, last year insinuated that there may have been a sexual relationship between Smollett and Abel whilst giving an interview on Good Morning America. The Osundairo brothers sued the lawyers for defamation, claiming the comments put them at risk as their home country's laws state that homosexuality is punishable by up to 14 years in jail. A judge later dismissed the defamation suit.  The saga began on January 29 last year when it emerged that Smollett told police he had been the victim of a racist, anti-gay attack while he was walking home in the early hours of that morning. He told police afterwards his attackers identified him from the show he was on, Empire, and called him both the N-word and 'f****t'.He said they beat him, poured bleach on him then put a noose around his neck. Smollett went back to his apartment where his friend, Frank Gaston, was. It was Gaston who insisted they call police. When officers arrived, the actor refused to hand over his phone. He went to the hospital to be checked over but had no major injuries. The Chicago Police Department vowed to investigate the incident with all its might, and celebrities around the world rushed to share their support of Smollett. Hebecame a household name almost overnight. But as the police investigation progressed, leaks began from within the police department that all may not have been as it seemed. As the controversy grew, Smollett - determined to make his case - went on Good Morning America where he cried and insisted he was telling the truth. By then, Chicago PD had released grainy surveillance camera footage of two men walking near the scene of the incident itself which was among the only part of his journey not captured on Chicago's vast network of security cameras that night. January 29: The 'hoax' attack outside Smollett's apartment in Chicago occurs. January 30: A wave of public sympathy rushes over Smollett, until then a relatively unknown actor February 14: After a series of unfavorable leaks from the Chicago PD, Smollett goes on Good Morning America to plead his case. Unbeknownst to him, brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo are being interviewed by police after returning from Nigeria. February 20: Smollett is arrested and accused of lying to police. He is bailed out on a $10,000 cash bond. March 7: Grand jury indicted Smollett March 26: Charges dropped April 11: Chicago sues Smollett for $130,000 - the cost of the investigation August: Dan Webb is appointed special prosecutor November: Smollett counter-sues, alleging malicious prosecution February 11, 2020: Reports emerge that Dan Webb has charged Smollett  Smollett unequivocally identified the two men in the grainy footage as his attackers. Neither their faces nor skin color could be made out in it. Unbeknownst to him while he was conducting his GMA interview, the Chicago PD was building a case against him. They had identified the people in the video as the Osundairo brothers and had backed-up their belief by tracking the pair's movements in the days and hours both before and after the incident. Smollett was eventually arrested and charged with suspicion of lying to police. The brothers flew to Nigeria within hours of the January 29 incident and missed the media storm which followed When they landed back in the US, police investigators were waiting to question them. After hours of secret interviews, they told cops that Smollett had paid them $3,500 to carry out the attack as part of an elaborate hoax. Smollett was then arrested. In an extraordinary press conference afterwards, then police chief Eddie Johnson accused him of inflaming race relations in Chicago and of wasting police time. He bellowed that Smollett had tried to leverage the 'attack' to get his bosses at Empire to pay him more. Despite police outrage, prosecutor Kim Foxx was quiet. The case then went to a grand jury which returned a stunning, 16-felony indictment that would have put Smollett behind bars for more than 50 years if he had been convicted. By then, Foxx had informally recused herself from the case. Her conflict of interest was that in the early days of the police investigation, she intervened at the request of Smollett's family and their friend - Time's Up CEO Tina Tchen - who wanted the FBI to take over the police investigation. They said they were worried by the number of leaks that had come from the Chicago PD and asked Foxx to help. She said she would try. After the grand jury indictment, the case stalled for a few weeks. Then, in March, Foxx's deputy Joseph Magats - who had taken over - announced the decision that the charges against Smollett had been dropped. Foxx had intervened again, it emerged, and pointed to what they called 'alternative prosecution' whereby Smollett, a first-time offender, was let off with a $10,000 bail forfeiture and community service. There was outrage and calls for Foxx to be investigated herself for prosecutorial misconduct. As judges and special prosecutors for that task were tossed around, the city came out swinging in civil court. They sued Smollett, asking him to reimburse them for all the money they said they'd wasted investigating what they believed were bogus claims. Smollett counter-sued, accusing the city and Eddie Johnson of malicious prosecution.He lost his job on Empire and became a pariah in the showbiz world he was allegedly trying to ascend through. Special Prosecutor Dan Webb was appointed last August to examine what occurred in the case. After the investigation, Smollett was indicted in February on six counts pertaining to making four false police reports. He returned to court on February 24 and pleaded not guilty. Smollet's attorney Tina Glandian issued a statement at the time saying: 'The attempt to re-prosecute Mr. Smollett one year later on the eve of the Cook County State's Attorney election is clearly all about politics not justice.' However, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot issued a damning indictment of Smollet saying:'He committed a crime, and he needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and we are going to continue to aggressively make him accountable for the wasted police resources that went into investigating what turned out to be a total hoax.' The case is ongoing."
"A California man shot and killed his wife and two teenage sons, then took his own life as deputies arrived at his home and ordered him to surrender. The Riverside County Coroner's Office has identified the suspected gunman in the triple murder-suicide that took place in Menifee on April 6 as Roberto Perez, 39. According to the Riverside County Sheriff's Office, Perez killed his wife,Yareli Vidal-Venegas, 33, and their sons,David Aguirre, 15, and Ronaldo Vidal, 16. The couple's daughter, who has not been named, was not harmed. It is unclear whether she was home at the time of the carnage. Authorities said in a statement that just before 4pm on April 6, deputies responded to the family's home in the 31000 block of Sherman Road in Menifee for a reported domestic violence incident. Deputies made contact with Perez, who refused to exit the house and told them he had shot his wife and children. The responding officers negotiated with Perez to surrender, but he refused. During the standoff, deputies a single gunshot from inside the home. When they entered the residence, they found Perez dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The man's wife and sons were found mortally wounded. Two of the family members were pronounced dead at the scene, and a third was rushed to a hospital and pronounced dead on arrival. A loved one has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help the family with the funeral expenses of the deceased mother and sons. 'We know they are now in heaven and have or feel no pain, they were selfless people, their laughs were so contagious and they could brightened any room,' wrote Samantha Harding in the description. 'They were all 3 very unique and caring they would be willing to help everyone in need.' Both Ronaldo, known to is friends as 'Nano,' and his younger brother, David, were students at Paloma Valley High School. PrincipalJennifer Thomasian released a statement on Facebook last week confirming their deaths and mourning their loss. 'It is with an incredibly heavy heart that I share with you the loss of two of our Wildcats,' she wrote. 'Nothing can prepare us for the loss of a friend or loved one, at any age.'"
"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in Arizona discovered two migrants hidden in the trunk of a car after they had unlawfully crossed the Mexico-United States border on Sunday. CBP said in a statement released Tuesday that agents assigned to an immigration checkpoint on state Route 85 nearGila Bend conducted the search of a Buick sedan with a sniffer dog. During the investigation, the Border Patrol officers found that a 39-year-old woman from Phoenix was smuggling the two undocumented individuals. The Honduran migrants were immediately processed and deported to Mexico. CBP said the driver of the vehicle was arrested and could be charged with human trafficking. The federal law enforcement agency said it has expedited the deportation of individuals who are caught entering the United States without legal documentation after the government set up several command stations near the American side of the Mexico-U.S. border. The so-called 'one-stop' centers have been operating since dating back to March 14. Under Title 42, CBP is allowed to expel some immigrants through ports of entry instead of transporting them to Border Patrol stations. The decision, the agency said, eliminates the risk of detained undocumented immigrants contracting COVID-19. 'Despite traditional risks of human beings being stuffed into a trunk, there's now increased risk due to exposure to coronavirus,' said Tucson Sector Border Patrol Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Michele Morales. 'These human smuggling tactics increase exposure risks for our agents, those they smuggle, and endanger the safety of the American people.'"
"Kanye West is officially voting for Donald Trump in November's Presidential Election. The 42-year-old rapper made the declaration in the May issue of GQ magazine, defiantly stating: 'We know who I'm voting on... I'm not going to be told by the people around me and the people that have their agenda that my career is going to be over because of it!' West, who famously donned a Make America Great Again cap and visited President Trump at the White House in October 2018, told the publication that 'better real estate' is the primary motivation for his decision. 'I buy real estate. It's better now than when Obama was in office. They don't teach you in school about buying property. They teach you how to become somebody's property,' he claimed. West and his wife, Kim Kardashian, own four lavish properties dotted across the United States. The couple's primary residence is a $19 million mansion located in Hidden Hills, Calabasas. They have reportedly spent a further $20 million on extensions and renovations. They also own two separate ranches in Wyoming and a luxury condo in Miami. When asked whether he was worried about being an outcast in liberal Hollywood due to his political preferences, West snapped back: 'Celebrities are scared! Celebrities don't have the real voice... What's the point of being a celebrity if you can't have an opinion?' The controversial rapper also trashed Hillary Clinton's 2016 'I'm With Her' slogan, stating: 'I was told my career would end if I wasn't with her. What kind of campaign is that, anyway? That's like if Obama's campaign was 'I'm with black.'' 'Both my parents were freedom fighters... they didn't fight for me to be told by white people which white person I can vote on!' West, who landed in hot water back in 2018 for claiming that slavery was 'a choice', also made several controversial comments on race in his wide-ranging chat with GQ. 'One in three African Americans are enslaved, and we go more crazy if, you know, someone scores a touchdown,' he stated. 'Modern-day mass incarceration is right in front of us, and if I even use the wordslavery, I'm treated like I'm a white person talking about slavery.' In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina back in 2005, West famously claimed that then President George Bush 'didn't care about black people'. However, in his interview with GQ, the star appeared to express regret at uttering those famous phrase, claiming it was indicative of a 'victim mentality'. ''George Bush doesn't care about black people' is a victim statement. That is stemmed in victim mentality. Every day I have to look in the mirror like I'm Robert De Niro and tell myself, 'You are not a slave.' As outspoken as I am, and the position that I am in, I need to tell myself.' Kanye was interviewed by GQ on four separate occasions over the course of two months for his cover piece. In the wide-ranging interviews he also discussed his battle with alcoholism and his path to born-again Christianity among other topics. 'I've given my life to Christ': Kanye on becoming a born-again Christian During one of his sit-down conversations with GQ, West spoke candidly about finding God and stated that he 'definitely' considers himself a born-again Christian. The rapper, who recently started a Sunday Service gospel group, claimed he has 'given his life to Christ' and is 'healed' by the spiritual connections he has when he worships. 'I surround myself with the healing—the highest-level healing possible: singing about Jesus with my friends and family surrounding me [at Sunday Service] every single week,' he declared. West also says that his newfound Christianity means he is obligated to speak up on matters that are important to him. 'People don't realize that Christians are loud. That we have a right to righteous anger. That Jesus flipped tables. 'They think that all of a sudden you believe in Christ, so we're not even supposed to speak up. And if we speak up, people will say, 'Oh, you're being judgmental.' And it's like, Oh, now, because I'm Christian, I don't even have an opinion any more? I'm Christian and I still have an opinion. But my opinion is based on the Word.' West also warned against the dangers of sin and the importance of repentance, stating: 'To live inside of sin, it's going to cost you more than you can pay. You don't want to continue to sin with no repentance. I understand that people feel that I've made some cultural sins. But the only real sins are the sins against God, and you don't want to continue to sin against God.' Aside from his Sunday Service, West last year came up with plans to house the homeless as part of his Christian outreach. The aspiring architect designed Star Wars-inspired futuristic pods that he hoped to build in a one-of-a kind community that dismantled the class system and sheltered the homeless. He built prototypes on his Calabasas property that had to be torn down because they breached building laws. 'Kobe was the basketball version of me': Kanye on his friendship with late LA Lakers legend Bryant  One of West's interviews with GQ took place shortly after the death of LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant in January. West and Bryant had known each other for many years, with the musician telling the magazine that they close friends. 'He was the basketball version of me, and I was the rap version of him, and that's facts!We got the commercials that prove it. No one else can say this. We came up at the same time, together,' he claimed. West also stated that the untimely death would serve as an inspiration for him - and millions of others - to make the most of their lives. 'It's game time. There's no move that we can't make, or that we'll wait to make. Everyone in our life is now a member of the Lakers on one of Kobe's championship teams,' he stated. 'The way that Kobe would say that we all have to come together and win this championship is the way I look at life now. To an infinite, other level. 'All of those awards shows partially led me to alcoholism': Kanye reveals his battle with the bottle While West told GQ that he has not had a drink in some time, he admitted he was at one point a 'functioning alcoholic', and partly blamed Hollywood for his struggles. The star revealed he previously drank Grey Goose with orange juice in the morning, but hasn't touched alcohol since coming to a realization about the pace of his life. He was also snapped at the 2009 Video Music Awards drinking from a bottle of Hennessy. West admitted the only way he was able to even handle the show was with a drink in hand. 'Right? I really grabbed the drink to be able to even go to the awards show due to the information that everyone knows now. To say, ""Okay, I can handle this,""' he claimed. 'Well, it's good that we found out about all of those awards shows that partially led me to alcoholism,' he stated. 'One day I was in my office working on the couture collection, and there was some Grey Goose in the fridge and I was just going to get a daytime drink, and I looked and thought, 'Devil, you're not going to beat me today.' That one statement is like a tattoo.' While most topics were on the table during the GQ interviews, West did not mention his very famous wife and children. He has been married to Kim Kardashian since 2014, and the pair share four children: North, Saint, Psalm and Chicago."
"Kanye West revealed that the death of 'one of my best friends' Kobe Bryant was 'a game changer for me.' Kobe died aged 41 this January with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other people in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. 'He was the basketball version of me, and I was the rap version of him, and that’s facts!' the 42-year-old said in a GQinterview conducted three days after Kobe's death. Kanye shared: 'One thing I thought was really amazing is that we were able to find a groove with the photographs today even as out of it as I was with the loss of Kobe. We were able to just go to the court and play ball.' The rap icon, who lives in Calabasas with his wife Kim Kardashian and their four children, reflected on driving along Las Virgines Road where the helicopter crashed. 'There’s one street that I drive to go from either my office or my home to the property where the domes were built.So now there’s no way for me not to be as determined as Kobe every time I drive down that street. It’s game time,' he said. 'There’s no move that we can’t make, or that we’ll wait to make. Everyone in our life is now a member of the Lakers on one of Kobe’s championship teams. The way that Kobe would say that we all have to come together and win this championship is the way I look at life now. To an infinite, other level,' Kanye went on. 'This is a game changer for me. He was the basketball version of me, and I was the rap version of him, and that’s facts! We got the commercials that prove it.' The duo starred in Nike ads together, including one commercial for the basketball star's Kobe System shoes. In one ad, Kanye plays a villain making an escape on a helicopter - until Kobe throws an explosive basketball at the aircraft which bursts into flames and crashes. Kanye told GQ: 'No one else can say this. We came up at the same time, together. And now it’s like, yeah, I might have had a reputation for screaming about things - but I’m not taking any mess for an answer now. We’re about to build a paradigm shift for humanity. We ain’t playing with ’em. We bringing home the trophies.' Kobe and Kanye were friends for many years and the basketball star even contributed to the rapper's remix of his single Power in 2010. When Kobe played his final game for the Lakers in 2016 before retiring, Kanye was at the Staples Center to cheer him on. This January 26, hours after the helicopter crash, Kanye paid tribute to the victims during his weekly Sunday Service. He and Kim could also be spotted in the audience at the NBA All-Star Game in Chicago this February where a tribute was held in memory of Kobe. The couple, along with Kim's sister Khloe Kardashian and mother Kris Jenner, also attended the tribute event to Kobe and Gianna and the Staples Center that month."
"Jeffrey Epstein's victims have left the door open to sue Prince Andrew after they receive compensation from the dead paedophile’s estate, legal documents reveal. The women are close to striking a deal with the £513million estate of the Wall Street financier, who was close friends with the Duke of York. But lawyers representing the victims, who include Andrew’s accuser Virginia Roberts, say they will not let ‘certain individuals’ escape liability through the agreement. In an explosive email, Miss Roberts’s lawyer David Boies names ‘Prince Andrew or others to whom our clients were trafficked’ among those individuals. Miss Roberts claims she had sex with the duke three times aged 17 when she was Epstein’s ‘slave’ – claims Andrew emphatically denies. US prosecutors and the FBI have been trying to get Andrew to answer questions about his association with Epstein for months – but say he has failed to respond. The new documents were filed this week to the Superior Court of the US Virgin Islands, which is handling Epstein’s will. Lawyers representing dozens of women are negotiating with the co-executors of Epstein’s estateabout the terms under which they will receive compensation. One outstanding issue is a ‘release’ document to be signed by the victims which would protect a number of Epstein’s former associates against legal liability for their actions. On April 7, Mr Boies wrote to the co-executors that any settlement cannot allow Andrew to be ‘released’ – but the overall terms of the release were acceptable. He said victims should have in the release ‘a space to make clear that certain individuals (e.g. Prince Andrew or others to whom our clients were trafficked) are not released’. This means that if the victims receive payments – expected to be in the millions of pounds – they can still try to pursue the duke. Lawyers for Andrew declined to comment on Wednesday night."
"Cherry blossom season is in full swing but residents across the United States should be inside, unable to enjoy the festive time to the fullest as they practice social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Trees are sprouting lovely flowers in parks that barely have any visitors, save for the occasional masked dog walker and jogger. In Washington D.C., the Metropolitan Police Department has set up a perimeter around the Tidal Basin to ensure social distancing measures are kept. They are also keeping people away from the trees. The police are being assisted by the Washington D.C. National Guard. The dates for the cherry blossom season were from March 20 to April 12 in D.C, according to the National Cherry Blossom website. The National Cherry Blossom Festival has launched a virtual Festival experience that allowed viewers the chance to 'enjoy springtime together, while being apart.' 'The nation's greatest springtime celebration will continue but it will look different this year thanks to the team and our creative partners at VIVA Creative,' they added. The peak bloom date, according to the National Park Service, is the day when 70 per cent of blossoms of Yoshino cherry trees that surround the Tidal Basin are open. Weather condition cause the date to vary from year to year. 'The blooming period is defined as the time when 20% of the blossoms are open until the petals fall and leaves appear,' the festival added on their website. 'The blooming period starts several days before the peak bloom date and can last as long as 14 days.' In New York, the Sakura Matsuri festival has been an annual tradition at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden since 1982. They've cancelled the festival at the garden, because of the virus, making it nearly impossible for tree lovers to witness all 214 of them. Those looking to see the trees can see a few while looking through the Eastern Parkway entrance, the New York Timesreports. There is also a place to view the trees from a parking lot between the Brooklyn Museum and the garden on Washington Avenue. 'It's really amazing to hear what the garden sounds like,' said Elizabeth Reina-Longoria, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's director of marketing and communications. 'You're just hearing so many birds and nature sounds all around you that you wouldn't necessarily hear at this time of year with lots of other people around.' The garden has taken to updating its CherryWatch tracker daily and is sharing videos from past videos later in the month on April 25 and 26. That weekend was when the festival was to take place. The New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx is also closed but offering a cherry tracker as well. Those in New York City, who should be inside, hoping to look at the trees can go to Central Park to enjoy the beautiful sights. "
"Willie Davis, a Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive lineman who helped the Green Bay Packers win each of the first two Super Bowls, has died at age 85. The Packers confirmed Davis' death to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Wednesday, as did his former teammate and fellow hall member, Dave Robinson. The cause of death has not be publicized. A 15th-round draft pick from Grambling, Davis began his NFL career by playing both offense and defense for the Cleveland Browns in 1958 and '59. He had his greatest success after getting traded to the Packers. He remained with the Packers until finishing his NFL career in 1969 as a five-time All-Pro. Although tackles and sacks weren't measured at the time Davis played, his 22 career fumble recoveries showcased his dominance and big-play ability. Davis's death comes nearly two months after his former Packers teammate Willie Wood died from natural causes at age 83. Like Wood, Davis was voted to the NFL's all-decade team for the 1960s and was inducted into the Hall of Fame. 'There were few players in the league who were as tough as Willie,' Packers Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr said in the foreword to Davis' book, 'Closing The Gap: Lombardi, the Packers Dynasty and the Pursuit of Excellence. 'He was at his best in games in which we struggled. When it was tough, he rose to the top and took our defensive people right along with him.' Davis helped the Packers win the NFL championship in 1965 before capping the 1966 and 1967 seasons with titles in the first two Super Bowls. But he didn't initially embrace the move to Green Bay. Davis noted in his book that he had just signed a contract with the Browns and believed he was being groomed as Cleveland's future starting left tackle on offense when he learned about the trade on the radio. Green Bay acquired Davis in a July 1960 trade that sent wide receiver A.D. Williams to Cleveland. 'At the time, I felt slightly betrayed,' Davis wrote in his book. 'I felt the organization didn't care much about me, like I was being thrown away. I also panicked, wondering what this would mean for my future. I absolutely did not want to play in Green Bay. In fact, I was so turned off by the idea that my first thought was about retiring.' He instead stuck it out and developed into one of the top defensive linemen of his era. In an NFL Films tribute to Davis, former Packers center Bill Curry called him 'the finest combination of leader and player that I ever saw.' In that same tribute, former Packers offensive lineman and Hall of Fame member Forrest Gregg said that 'I can't ever remember a football game that he played in where I didn't think Willie Davis played absolutely the best he could possibly play that day.' Davis forced a Johnny Unitas fumble to help seal the Packers' 1966 Western Conference championship, and he tormented Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson and Raiders quarterback Daryle Lamonica in the first two Super Bowls. 'He put as much fear in me, because of what he could do and his abilities, as any defensive end that I had to face,' Dawson told NFL Films. Wood had a key interception that game, picking off a pass from Dawson and returning it 50 yards to set up a third-quarter touchdown that sealed the Packers' 35-10 victory. Davis earned a master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago late in his NFL career, which helped him make a successful transition to the business world after he stopped playing. 'We all knew football wasn't going to last forever,' Davis wrote in his book. 'The longevity of the average football player was less than 10 years, and that meant there were many men who were jobless with little financial security by the time they were in their early 30s. That was a scary prospect. I wanted to make sure I didn't fall into that category.' Davis instead had a successful business career and served on the boards of directors for several companies, including Dow Chemical Co., Sara Lee Corp., Schlitz Brewing and Mattel Toys. He also was on the Packers' board of directors from 1994-2005. 'Along the way, there were key moments at each stage, key opportunities that, when I took full advantage of them, propelled me to the next level,' Davis wrote in his book. 'I had some slip-ups along the way, but when it mattered, when it was important, I stepped up, practiced what I believed, took the advice of those I respected and went for it with everything I could give. That's how I succeeded in football, business and beyond.'"
"Two civil rights groups filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday challenging a new Idaho law banning transgender women from competing in women's sports, the first such law in the nation. The American Civil Liberties Union and Legal Voice filed the lawsuit contending the law violates the U.S. Constitution because it is discriminatory and an invasion of privacy. The groups also said the law scheduled to take effect July 1 is a violation of Title IX, the 1972 law that bars sex discrimination in education. The groups in the 60-page lawsuit ask the court to permanently prevent Idaho from enforcing the law. Republican Governor Brad Little late last month signed into law the measure that received overwhelming support in the Republican-dominated House and Senate, but no support from Democrats. The ban applies to all sports teams sponsored by public schools, colleges and universities. A girls' or women's team will not be open to transgender students who identify as female. Backers said the law, called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, is needed because transgender female athletes have physical advantages. Specifically, the lawsuit contends the law violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause because it is discriminatory and the 4th Amendment's protections against invasion of privacy because of tests required should an athlete's gender be challenged. Two plaintiffs are bringing the lawsuit. One is an unnamed Boise area high school student who is cisgender. Cisgender refers to someone whose gender identity corresponds with the sex the person was identified as having at birth. The other is Lindsay Hecox, 19, who will be a sophomore this fall at Boise State University and hopes to qualify for the women's cross-country team. She competed on the boys' team at a Moorpark, California, high school before transitioning after graduating. 'I would like to compete as a female,' she said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'We shouldn't have our privacy invaded. If people started questioning me, I wouldn't want to be subjected to multiple tests.' The NCAA has a policy allowing transgender athletes to compete. But the sponsor of the Idaho law, Republican Barbara Ehardt, has called the NCAA policy 'permissive.' Ehardt has said that allowing transgender athletes on girls´ and women´s teams would negate nearly 50 years of progress women have made since the 1972 Title IX legislation that's credited with opening up sports to female athletes, and along with it scholarships and other opportunities. Earlier this year in Connecticut, the families of three female high school runners filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block transgender athletes from participating in girls sports. The families contend that allowing athletes with male anatomy to compete has deprived their daughters of track titles and scholarship opportunities. Opponents of the Idaho law said it codified in state statute a government-mandated gynecological exam, likely causing some potential athletes to avoid sports. They argued that anyone from a parent to an opposing player or someone with a grudge could require a student to take a humiliating test. The law 'illegally targets women and girls who are transgender and intersex and subjects all female athletes to the possibility of invasive genital and genetic screenings,' said Gabriel Arkles, senior staff attorney with the ACLU. 'Alongside Idahoans throughout the state, we have been fighting this hateful, unconstitutional legislation since it was introduced,' said ACLU of Idaho Legal Director Ritchie Eppink. The Idaho law is one of two anti-transgender bills signed into law by Little in March, making Idaho the first among states that introduced some 40 such bills this year to enact them. The other Idaho law taking effect this summer prohibits transgender people from changing the sex listed on their birth certificates, and is almost certain to be challenged in court. The birth certificate law ignores a 2018 federal court ruling that a past law barring transgender people from making the birth certificate changes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The judge scrapped the ban and warned against new rules. The Idaho attorney general's office, which didn't appeal the ruling, said it could cost $1 million if the state had to defend the ban again and lost. Peter Renn of Lambda Legal, the law firm that represented two transgender women whose lawsuit led to the court ruling, said Idaho can't enforce that new law without violating a court order. A third proposed Idaho law that would have criminalized treating transgender youth for dysphoria died in a House committee after the chairman decided to not have a vote on the measure. Previouslythe families of three female high school runners have filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block transgender athletes in Connecticut from participating in girls' sports. On March 24, the US Justice Department came out in support of the lawsuit, arguing that the state's inclusive policy violates the federal Title IX law allowing girls equal educational and athletic opportunities. Attorney General William Barr signed what is known as a statement of interest, arguing against the policy of the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, the board that oversees the state's high school athletic competitions. The conference allows athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify, arguing it is following a state law that requires high school students be treated according to their gender identity. It also argues the policy is in accordance with Title IX. The Justice Department, in its filing, disagrees. 'Under CIAC's interpretation of Title IX, however, schools may not account for the real physiological differences between men and women. Instead, schools must have certain biological males - namely, those who publicly identify as female - compete against biological females,' Barr and the other department officials write. 'In so doing, CIAC deprives those women of the single-sex athletic competitions that are one of the marquee accomplishments of Title IX.' The lawsuit was filed in February by runners Selina Soule, a senior at Glastonbury High School; Chelsea Mitchell, a senior at Canton High School; and Alanna Smith, a sophomore at Danbury High School, against the conference and several local boards of education. (Smith is the daughter of former MLB relief pitcher Lee Smith) The girls' lawsuit centers on two transgender sprinters, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, who have frequently outperformed their cisgender competitors. The two seniors have combined to win 15 girls state indoor or outdoor championship races since 2017, according to the lawsuit."

"A 29-year-old woman is urging all Australians to undergo routine skin checks after a tiny red spot above her eyebrow turned out to be a form of skin cancer. Marlene Millott, from Melbourne,had noticed a small blemish on her face a few months back, but never thought anything of it. The young woman, who works at a research centre at Monash University, quickly dismissed the spot as a 'weird pimple' and covered it up with makeup. 'It was just a red spot, I didn't really think anything of it. It had been there for a few months and I was easily able to cover it up,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Millott would only learn the tiny 'pimple' was actually basal cell carcinoma during a visit to a local clinic, which she saw a recommendation for on Facebook. With skin cancer running in her family, Ms Millott said she always intended to get checked as a precautionary measure, but had been putting it off for months, and wasn't worried about her 'pimple'. 'You just assume it's something that affects people who are a little bit older,' she said. 'But once I started seeing commentary online,especially one girl who posted about the clinic around the corner from me, it was like a bit of a push. 'I didn't really suspect that I had anything, it was just something I thought I should get into the habit of doing.' Ms Millott visited Molescreen Skin Cancer Clinic in Camberwell on March 17, and was immediately asked about the tiny spot. 'I walked into the doctor's office and one of the first things she said to me was, ""what's the spot above your eyebrow?"" 'I'm sure so many people assume moles are the ones you're supposed to be scared of, I just hadn't really thought anything about this little red spot, but she was concerned straightaway.' Ms Millott was scheduled for a biopsy on March 19 and by March 24, she wouldreceive alarming news she had basal cell carcinoma. The cancer is the most common form of skin cancer, and unlike melanoma, it grows very slowly. Ms Millott was told the cancer could have potentially spread to other areas and cause death if gone undetected, however, death from basal cell carcinoma is rare. 'Because I had a family history I always thought it'd happen to me at some point but I just never realised it would be when I was so young,' Ms Millott said. 'I was quite upset and scared by it but I had already prepared myself for it, so it wasn't a huge shock.' Ms Millott said the bigger shock was the actual removal process, which required doctors to slice off a 9mm by 3mm piece of skin from her face in a procedure for which she was conscious. The area was then sewn up with seven stitches. 'I was really upset and scared because I thought it was going to be a small thing but it was a bit more dramatic than I expected, that part was quite traumatic,' she said. 'I was so worried that I would end up looking like Scar from the Lion King or something.' Ms Millott, who has since removed her stitches and has been declared cancer free, said the experience has taught her to be more protective of her skin. 'I've always been quite good trying to look after my skin. I always wear sunscreen when I go to the beach or if I've been out for too long, but obviously I'm not perfect and sometimes forget to reapply. 'I think the position on my face as well, above my eyebrow, you might miss it if you're putting on sunscreen because it's sort of in the hair a little bit. 'The other issue is I would wear makeup most days and that would make me a bit lazy about wearing sunscreen as well. 'But since I've had this happen, I've just been making sure I wear it everyday.' Ms Millottis now encouraging Australians to learn from her ordeal and to get routine checks even if they do not think they're vulnerable. 'I had booked a random appointment thinking it would be fine, and didn't realise that I would come out with quite a serious result,' she said.  'People should check about clinics in their area, but the one I went to is still open and taking appropriate safety measures for COVID-19. 'So if people are concerned about a spot, they should go get checked now and not wait until things are back to normal.'"
" Tiger King's Joe Exotic surrounded himself with a menagerie of misfits, who were arrested for DUIs, unlawful possessions of weapons, assault and fraud. Eccentric zoo owner Joe Exotic, who is currently serving 22 yearsin federal prisonfor plotting to have his arch nemesis Carole Baskin murdered and killing five tigers, foundmost of his employees off Craigslist. He admitted in the hit Netflix docuseries that many were drug addicts, homeless or fresh from jail, as he provided them a small wage and a place to live in exchange for working at the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma. But beyond DUIs and minor infractions with the law, several zoo employees were arrested for assault, unlawful possession of firearms and fraud. Here, DailyMail.com breaks down the cast members' arrests and charges againstthem. John Finlay: Joe Exotic's former husband Finlay met Joe in 2003 when the then 19-year-old came to work for him at the zoo, with their relationship quickly turning romantic. The now 35-year-old even had a tattoo just below his belt line that read 'PRIVATELY OWNED BY JOE EXOTIC'. He since has had it covered up. The Netflix docuseries shows Finlay, Joe Exotic and Travis Maldonado in a three-way wedding ceremony, but soon after their relationship ended on a bad note. In 2005 while working at the zoo, Finlay was arrested for leaving a carcass of an animal in an unlawful place. On August 18, 2014, he was arrested for domestic assault and battery when he reportedly attacked Joe, though he was never charged. Months later in October 2014, Finlay filed a protective order against Joe, but four days later it was dismissed because the court found he failed to meet the burden of proof. In September 2018, the mother of this young biological daughter, filed a petition for a protective order against him. In the petition order she claimed that Finlay told her that 'he would put a bullet in anyone who stood between him and his child.' She also claimed Finlay 'has told numerous people he wanted to leave state with (their daughter), and he was headed to Florida before he faced prison.' An emergency order was granted, but weeks later it was dismissed because the police couldn't locate Finlay in order to serve him. Jeff Lowe: Current owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park Lowe has had his fair share of legal drama, reportedly sued by Prince in 2007 for allegedly selling clothes with his trademarked symbol on them. In 2008, Lowe pleaded guilty to mail fraud, stemming from a scheme in which he posed as an employee of an abuse organization to obtain more than $1 million worth of goods for a fraction of their value, reported theBeaufort Gazette. Ten years later, Lowe was arrested and charged in Las Vegas with three counts unlawful possession of wild animals in 2018. Lowe was running a tiger cub party business in which heallegedly picked up customers in a party bus and drove around the Las Vegas strip while customers played with the cubs. As part of the plea agreement, Lowe agreed to surrender the animals and pay a $10,000 fine. Lowe never showed up to a later court date for a status check and a bench warrant was issued. The warrant came to light after he became a household name from Netflix's Tiger King. Lowe told Dailymail.com the warrant for his arrest 'is a paperwork error' and he has a new court date on June 1st where 'he'll take care of it.' Joshua Dial: Joe Exotic's former campaign manager Joe Exotic hired Joshua Dial as his campaign manager forhis failed bid for president in 2016 and subsequent bid for Oklahoma Governor in 2017. The 31-year-old has been arrested at least five times. Joe found Dial working at a local Oklahoma Walmart where he managed the sales of gun and ammo before Joe asked him to help him on his campaign. Dial was arrested at the tender age of 21 in February 2011, when he was arrested for marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. Six months later he was arrested for driving under the influence and drug possession, then again in 2012 for a DUI. The aspiring politico kept himself out of trouble for a few years until he was arrested in 2017 for felony assault and battery in a probable cause affidavit exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com. The affidavit states that Dial 'cut/Stabbed/Slashed (victim) with a Japan Ninja Sword called a Katana. 'The victim has a large cut on the left forearm that appeared to be bleeding. 'The laceration was 11 cm x 4cm in size, the victim was sent to St. Anthony's hospital in Oklahoma City via Air Evacuation.' He later plead no contest to an amended misdemeanor charge of unlawful carry. He also had to forfeit his sword as a result of the plea agreement. Dial now attends a university in Oklahoma and aGoFundMe account was opened up to pay for his mental health care after his experiences with Joe Exotic and the zoo. Part of his trauma stems from witnessing Joe's third husband Travis Maldonado commit suicide which was caught on camera and shown on the Netflix docuseries. Kelci 'Saff' Saffery: Zoo employee who lost his arm in a 2013 tiger attack Kelci, who goes by 'Saff' and is a transgender man, has been arrested at least eight times according, to the Garvin County Oklahoma Sheriff's Department. He's been arrested for a DUI, carrying weapons, obtaining goods by bogus check/false pretense and failure to appearwarrants. In one mugshot, Saff is seen wearing his zoo uniform, complete with his radio. James Garretson: FBI informant Garretson wasarrested in Oklahoma on April 12, 2009, for felonious assault by pointing a firearm at his father-in-law during a domestic dispute with his then wife. According to the police report, Garretson's estranged wife was moving things out of their marital residence and she called her father for his help. When Garretson arrived back to his house to pick up their two children, he saw his wife's father, grabbed a gun and pointed at him, telling him to get off his property. Both of his children saw Garretson waving his gun around. Garretson's wife and father left the residence and called the police. He was later arrest and charged with felonious assault by pointing a firearm. In June 2010, Garretson pleaded guilty to a single charge of felonious assault by pointing a firearm at an individual. He was given a deferred sentence of four years in prison, 50 hours of community service and a $2,500 fine. Frank Allen Glover: 'Hitman' Joe Exotic 'hired to kill Carole Baskin' Frank Allen Glover has a criminal history dating back to the mid 1990s and spread out over four states. He's been arrested at least 20 times, including for an open container DUI, domestic violence, possession of less than one gram of crack. Glover recently admitted to DailyMail.com that he served several years in prison, with court records showing he served almost five years in a Georgia prison for aggravated assault. A source said Glover served time for stabbing someone, almost killing them. While living in Oklahoma. Glover was arrested twice in 2018. The first arrest happened in October when Glover drove his vehicle into another property, got out of his car and started to argue with the owner. He smelled of alcohol and was stumbling around, according to the police report. He was arrested and charged with a DUI. Just weeks later on November 14, 2018, Glover was again arrested for another DUI. He later pleaded no contest to both charges, was given a one year suspended sentence and paid a fine."
"Cats aren't as indifferent to their owners as they might seem — and can even get separation anxiety when left alone, just like dogs do, a study has found. More than one in ten cats exhibit behavioural issues when apart from their humans — with such often seen in single-pet households and those with no cat toys. Furthermore, cats appear more likely to have separationissues if living in a house with no women, two women or young adult owners. Reported behavioural problems includeaggressiveness, depression,excessive vocalisation and both inappropriate defecation and urination. The researchers conclude that, despite their aloof reputation, cats' social nature means that they can develop bonds with with owners. Scroll down for video  'This study provides information about behavioural signs consistent with separation-related problems (SRP) in a sampled population of domestic cats,' said paper author Daiana de Souza Machado, of Brazil's Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora. The investigation, she added, is also offering insights 'about the management practices used by [the cats'] owners.' 'The questionnaire identified that about 13 per cent of cats may have signs consistent with SRP according to their owners' reports, and therefore, it could be a promising tool for future research investigating SRP in cats.' In their study. the team developed a questionnaire for cat owners that required them to provide basic information about their cat. They were asked to describe what behaviours their cat showed signs of exhibiting when they were absent, as well as detailing both how they interact with their cat and the cat's living environment. In total, 130 respondents from the city of Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais, Brazil, who owned at least one adult cat, completed the surveys — covering at total of 223 felines. The researchers found that 13.5 per cent of cats (30 out of 223) met at least one of the criteria for having separation-related problems. The questionnaire also indicated that 20 out of the 30 cats exhibited destructive behaviour and other problematic behaviours or mental states. These included excessive vocalisation (19 out of 30 cats), inappropriate urination (18 cats), depression–apathy (16 cats), aggressiveness (11 cats), agitation–anxiety (11 cats) and inappropriate defecation (7 cats). They also found that separation-related behavioural changes appeared mainly in households with no women (or more than one), households with owners aged 18 to 35 years, single-pet households and households with no cat toys. The researcher's findings may help owners to identifying ways to reduce their furry friends'separation issues — such as byproviding more toys and addressing otherenvironmental factors. Concluding their paper, the team said that — despite the common belief that cats are happy being left alone for long periods of time — pet cats develop bonds with their owners, meaning their behaviour ultimately changes when they are separated. The full findings of the study were published in the journal PLOS ONE."
"Parents have a bigger carbon footprint than families without children due to the need for convenience, according to a new study. A study in Sweden foundtwo-adult households with children emit over 25 percent more carbon dioxide than two-adult households without children. Tighter time constraints and the need for convenient access to food and transport was to blame for increasing parents' carbon emissions, the economists found. While having children makes people think more about their child's future, the researchers say this doesn't make them greener at the expense of convenience. 'While having children makes people focus more on the future and, presumably, care more about the environment, our study suggests that parenthood does not cause people to become ""greener"",' saidProfessor Jason Shogren, from the University of Wyoming. Carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with all the activities of a person or other entity, such as a corporation or country. A carbon footprint is usually expressed as a measure of weight, as in tons of CO2 or CO2 equivalent per year. The term can also include emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide, or harmful chlorofluorocarbons. An abundance of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat and causes global temperatures to rise. 'In fact, the difference in CO2 emissions between parents and non-parents is substantial, and that's primarily because of increased transportation and food consumption changes. 'Becoming a parent can transform a person – he or she thinks more about the future and worries about future risks imposed on their children and progeny. 'But, while having children might be transformational, our results suggest that parents' concerns about climate change do not cause them to be ""greener"" than non-parent adults.' The study involved an analysis of expenditures on goods and services in Swedish households related to carbon emissions, such as food, travel and electricity use. Researchers found that parents with children at home buy more goods and services, such as meat and petrol, that emit CO2 compared with childless households. The greenest adult Swede, the team report, 'is childless and lives alone'. The team go as far as suggesting a link between having children and becoming 'browner' – the opposite of greener. 'Time constraints become more binding, and convenience may become more important, when people have children,' saidDr Linda Thunstrom, assistant professor at the University of Wyoming. 'Parents may need to be in more places in one day resulting in people driving themselves instead of using public transportation or bicycling. 'They also need to feed more people – eating more pre-prepared, red meat carbon-intensive meals may add convenience and save time.' The experts now recommend further research that could lead to policies aimed at easing Swedish parents' carbon footprint. Sweden has one of the world's highest female workforce rates, which the team noted may add to the time constraints of household with children and in turn increase a reliance on convenience. The disparity in the carbon footprints of Swedish households with and without children is striking as climate concerns are more pronounced in Sweden than most other developed countries. The country is also home to the most renowned climate activists in the world – 17-year-oldGreta Thunberg. Most Swedes believe climate change is real and have accepted sizeable CO2 taxes, and households with children are subsidised. Sweden also has generous parental leave and subsidised day care, and parents have a legal right to reduced work hours. Because of this, researchers said their findings likely apply to most other western countries, but on an even larger scale, such as the US, which is renowned for its reliance on convenience.  'If we're finding these results in Sweden, it's pretty safe to assume that the disparity in carbon footprints between parents and non-parents is even bigger in most other Western countries,' Dr Thunstrom said. The study was published in the journal PLOS One."
"Two women in Idaho have been arrested and charged with the robbery, kidnapping and aggravated assault (with a deadly weapon) of one of their love rivals. Chelsi Urias, 32, said she was sitting in a friend's garage around 8.30pm on March 24 when three masked women came in and beat hear with a socket wrench and brass knuckles, stealing her cell phone and $400. Maddeline McKenzie Ovard, 29, allegedly warned she'd 'slice [her] throat' and Tabatha Gigi McKnight, 37, allegedly threatened to 'shoot her' during the four-hour-long attack that ended with the victim being dumped nude in Wolverine Canyon, and with a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. The third woman has not been identified. According to the homeowner witness, at least one of the assailants was a 'blonde' woman and one was referred to as 'Tabby'. The Daily Beastreports that court document identify Urias as the victim. The victim told the Post Register that they believed she was in a relationship with Ovard's ex-boyfriend. In video footage filmed from the incident and sent to a friend of Urias via Facebook at 9.30pm, the victim 'argues with 'Tabatha' about sleeping with 'Javier,' the police report states. After leaving the floor of the garage covered in blood, they bundled Urias into her own car blindfolded and drove to a second residence. A friend said he saw her car being driven by someone else and attempted to follow it but lost track. Urias states they attempted to use a taser on her throat but it malfunctioned. The assailants told Urias that 'if she cooperated she would be ok', police documents state. 'Chelsi said that she didn't see any knives or guns on them, but that she knew that both Maddeline and Tabatha had access to those weapons and she feared that they were going to kill her and that she would never see her kids again,' the affidavit continues. As part of the torture the assailants shaved the victims head. Urias was left on a rock in the Bingham County canyon with only a towel, sweater and the blindfold. She experienced bruising, black eyes, dizziness and a loss of vision. Police learned of the incident around 5am the next day when the friend who received the Facebook Messenger video called 911. Ovard was arrested last Monday and her bond was set at $75,000. Her preliminary hearing is set for Friday at Bonneville County Courthouse. McKnight's hearing is next Wednesday. First-degree kidnapping is punishable with up to life in prison. Robbery is punishable by five years to life. Aggravated battery is punishable up to 15 years. Both women have been ordered not to have any contact with Urias. Anyone with information can call the Idaho Falls Police Department at 208-529-1200 or Bonneville County Crime Stoppers at ifcrime.org."
"A California man shot and killed his wife and two teenage sons, then took his own life as deputies arrived at his home and ordered him to surrender. The Riverside County Coroner's Office has identified the suspected gunman in the triple murder-suicide that took place in Menifee on April 6 as Roberto Perez, 39. According to the Riverside County Sheriff's Office, Perez killed his wife,Yareli Vidal-Venegas, 33, and their sons,David Aguirre, 15, and Ronaldo Vidal, 16. The couple's daughter, who has not been named, was not harmed. It is unclear whether she was home at the time of the carnage. Authorities said in a statement that just before 4pm on April 6, deputies responded to the family's home in the 31000 block of Sherman Road in Menifee for a reported domestic violence incident. Deputies made contact with Perez, who refused to exit the house and told them he had shot his wife and children. The responding officers negotiated with Perez to surrender, but he refused. During the standoff, deputies a single gunshot from inside the home. When they entered the residence, they found Perez dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The man's wife and sons were found mortally wounded. Two of the family members were pronounced dead at the scene, and a third was rushed to a hospital and pronounced dead on arrival. A loved one has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help the family with the funeral expenses of the deceased mother and sons. 'We know they are now in heaven and have or feel no pain, they were selfless people, their laughs were so contagious and they could brightened any room,' wrote Samantha Harding in the description. 'They were all 3 very unique and caring they would be willing to help everyone in need.' Both Ronaldo, known to is friends as 'Nano,' and his younger brother, David, were students at Paloma Valley High School. PrincipalJennifer Thomasian released a statement on Facebook last week confirming their deaths and mourning their loss. 'It is with an incredibly heavy heart that I share with you the loss of two of our Wildcats,' she wrote. 'Nothing can prepare us for the loss of a friend or loved one, at any age.'"
"Distressing new footage has emerged of passengers fleeing from an inferno jet as the Russian authorities today charged the plane's captain with negligence after it was hit by lightning. Forty-one people died in the blaze after the Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet 100 crash landed at Sheremetyevo, Moscow's business international airport. A video that forms part of the criminal investigation shows flames more than 100ft high engulfing the aircraft, yet 37 escaped from the horror. Captain Denis Evdokimov, 42, has claimed he is being made a scapegoat after his Murmansk-bound domestic flight was hit by lightning soon after takeoff. He faces up to seven years in jail if convicted. He returned to the airport making a rough 'jumping' emergency landing which led to fire engulfing the plane on 5 May last year, separate footage shows. The new video shows the plane spin to a halt with its rear engulfed in toxic flames. After some 17 seconds the first front chute is opened and four seconds later the first passenger escapes onto the tarmac. The second chute is opened after 30 seconds. Passengers from the front of the plane slide out of the aircraft and run from the burning Superjet. The emergency services are seen arriving and seeking to extinguish the inferno. The Russian Investigative Committee announced today that Evdokimov had been formally charged with violation of safety rules and the negligent control of his plane leading mass deaths, harm to health and major damage. His failure to control the lightning-hit Superjet 'resulted in the destruction … of the aircraft' killing 40 passengers and one crew member. Ten people were injured. In all, 37 people escaped alive from the carnage. State investigators in charge of 'particularly important cases' say the actions of air traffic control and the emergency services on the ground were probed. They were found not to be responsible for the loss of life.Nor were there problems with the aircraft to prevent a safe emergency landing, said the committee. 'Investigators and experts studied the data of the flight recorders of the crashed aircraft, according to which during the flight the aircraft adequately responded to the pilot's control actions,' said a statement. The captain's lawyer Natalya Mitusova claims the experienced Aeroflot pilot is being made a scapegoat after suspicions that the authorities are seeking to protect the reputation of the Superjet, a Russian-made aircraft over which safety concerns have been raised. She claimed the aircraft did not 'obey' the pilot as he took manual control of the aircraft after the lightning strike. The dispute centres on what happened to the stricken plane when it was hit by lightning soon after taking off from Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow. Prosecutors say the pilot botched the landing, coming in at too steep an angle. This resulted in the rough landing when broken landing gear pierced the fuel tank, igniting the plane in flames.Most of the 41 victims of the disaster died from carbon monoxide poisoning or were burned alive. Mitusova said the Superjet was 'was thrown from side to side' and did not respond to his movements of the controls due to paralysis after the emergency. There was an 'incorrect reaction of the aircraft' to the pilot's actions in only the fourth time a Superjet had been landed fully manually, she said. The captain also claims that once on the ground a rear plane door was opened in violation of his orders and this led to the inferno on the exterior of the Superjet engulfing the passenger cabin. Most passengers who died were sitting in the rear or middle section of the aircraft. Without the rear emergency door having been opened, passengers would have had time to leave the cabin, claims the pilot. 'Someone from the crew or passengers opened the door, after which the fire entered the cabin,' said Mitusova. Evdokimov's legal team also allege ground rescue services were slow to get to the scene. The video was cut so it is not possible to be sure of the time it took before spraying started - but passengers were still emerging at this point. Investigators say the Superjet has been hit by lightning on 16 previous occasions, but this was the only time it led to catastrophe. Heroic Aeroflot flight attendants saved dozens of those on board the Moscow to Murmansk flight but 41 perished in the inferno either burned alive or overcome by toxic fumes. Prosecutors want a maximum seven years jail for the Evdokimov, whose father was a respected military pilot and Soviet air force major general. Svetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative Committee, said: 'Actions by Evdokimov violated the existing regulations and led to the destruction and outbreak of fire. 'As a result, 40 passengers and one crew member were killed, and (ten) others were badly injured.' In the aftermath of the horror, there were claims of serious technical problems on the Superjet - a plane supported by Vladimir Putin - were to blame."
"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that Americans have to 'live in the reality' that their options for president in November are to either elect former Vice President Joe Biden or reelect Donald Trump. The progressive New York representative signaled support for Biden's candidacy, openly admitting her reluctance to endorse the moderate Democrat. 'At the end of the day, one of these two people are going to be president. It's either going to be Donald Trump or Joe Biden that will be elected president in November,' Ocasio-Cortez lamented in a virtual interview with Politico Wednesday morning. 'We have to live in the reality of those choices,' she continued. 'And I know that there may be a lot of folks who are uncomfortable with that.' The freshman congresswoman added that for some families in New York's 14th district, which she represents, the decisions between Biden and Trump could mean 'life or death.' When Ocasio-Cortez was asked if she is expecting to endorse Biden, she said, 'Yeah. I think – we'll see. We're having conversations with Biden's team and trying to figure out what some of these policy conversations are looking like.' 'I think it's incredibly important that we support the Democratic nominee in November,' she said. Biden became the definite Democratic nominee last week after Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race – leaving the former vice president as the sole primary candidate for the party. The former vice president's nomination will not be official until the Democratic National Committee holds its convention in August. Ocasio-Cortez, who was a campaign surrogate for Sanders, weighed in during Wednesday's conversations on Biden's search for a running mate, claiming it should be a more progressive woman so she can help shift his presidential platform to the left. She did not, however, provide any names for who she wants it to be despite speculation and several names circulating that Biden is considering, including some of his past competition for the nomination. 'While I'm encouraged that Biden has said that he wants a woman of color to be his vice president, for me what's really important is not only just that woman's identity in terms of gender and cultural terms. But I think what's very important is who that woman is in her stances,' Ocasio-Cortez explained. 'I would hope that Biden's choice kind of signals that kind of branch where, you know, Barack Obama, I think he selected Joe Biden because they came even from different places politically,' she continued. 'I think it would be encouraging if Biden also picked someone who was a little bit more progressive that he knows may push him.' Ocasio-Cortez is a Democratic socialist, and Sanders was her preferred candidate as the most progressive of the 28 Democrats who were in the running for the primary at one point or another this cycle. Biden has already pledged to select a woman running mate. AOC, a nickname from her initials that the representative has embraced, has already expressed that she opposes several of Biden's presidential policy proposals – especially climate change and health care, which she says doesn't go far enough. 'The vice president does not have a climate change policy that is sufficient right now,' she told Politico. Ocasio-Cortez joined Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer for a virtual interview Wednesday morning as her district, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Her district, which includes parts of The Bronx and Queens, are some of the most hard-hit areas of the coronavirus outbreak, and this week New York surpassed 10,000 deaths. She also slammed Trump for his comments earlier this week claiming he has total authority on when states are to end their lockdowns and stay-at-home orders and reopen. Governors pushed back, claiming it was within their power to make these decisions for their respective states – and even Republican lawmakers slammed Trump's assertions, claiming it was against the Tenth Amendment for the federal government to overreach into states' powers. 'He can't have his cake and eat it too. You can't refuse to recommend shut downs, refuse to accept any responsibility for this crisis, and then all of the sudden turn around and think that you're going to tell governors what to do after you've abdicated all your responsibility to them. And I think that that's really the bind that he's in,' Ocasio-Cortez said. 'If he gave up power, then that's fine. We have to take that mantle of leadership and responsibility,' she said of state and local leadership."
"When Republicans in Wisconsin pushed through state elections last week in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, Jessica Jaglowski donned a protective mask and headed for the ballot box, determining her best shot at self-preservation was not to stay home but to vote Republicans out of office. Come November, when Republican President Donald Trump is up for re-election, Jaglowski, a 47-year-old Democrat in Milwaukee, says she will be even more determined to vote, even if the deadly virus continues to ravage her community. 'He's half the reason we're in this mess right now,' she said, criticizing Trump for downplaying the threat of COVID-19 before it hit the country hard. 'If I have to wait in line for 12 hours, in a storm, I don't care. I'm voting for whoever can get Trump out.' After three years in the White House, this much about Trump is clear: Those who want to deny him the presidency are much more determined to vote now than they were four years ago. Democrats' intention to vote is also rising more than it is among Republicans, both nationally and in historically competitive battleground states like Wisconsin that Trump narrowly won in 2016, according to more than 66,000 U.S. adults who took the Reuters/Ipsos online poll in the first quarter of 2020 or 2016. The highly motivated opposition is another sign of trouble for Trump, who saw his chief argument for re-election - a soaring economy and record-low unemployment - evaporate amid a health crisis that has put millions of Americans out of work. Even before the pandemic, Trump struggled to woo independents and moderates he would need to win November's election, and recent polls showed Trump trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden by several points nationwide, as well as in battleground states such as Arizona and Michigan. According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, 70% of Democrats said they were 'certain' to vote in the upcoming presidential election, 9 percentage points higher than in the first quarter of 2016. Among Republicans, the increase from 2016 was much smaller - 3 percentage points - with 71% saying they will vote in November. Democrats have for years outnumbered Republicans in the United States but they also tend to be less politically active. Yet for the first time since at least 2012, nearly the same percentage of Democrats and Republicans said they planned to vote in 2020. When the poll combined states that are expected to be especially competitive this year - Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Colorado - voting interest rose by 11 points among Democrats over the past four years, while it only rose by 3 points among Republicans. To be sure, a lot can happen in the next seven months to change the public´s interest in voting. The coronavirus pandemic has disproportionately hit Democratic-leaning urban communities, and it is unclear how a continuing, or resurgent virus will affect turnout in November. So far, people who support Trump are just as likely to be discouraged from voting during the coronavirus outbreak as those who oppose him, with the percentage of likely voters dropping equally, 8 percentage points each, Reuters/Ipsos polling from March shows. 'All the conventional wisdom and research suggests that (Trump) is in very big trouble,' said Maria Krupenkin, a political science professor at Boston College. 'But that same research also said he was in a bad position before the 2016 election' and Trump still won, Krupenkin said, referring to opinion polls that showed Democrat Hillary Clinton with a lead in the final few weeks before the vote. The rise in political enthusiasm was on display in the Democratic presidential nominating contests this year. Turnout in many states such as Michigan, Virginia and South Carolina surpassed previous highs set in 2008, when Barack Obama made his historic run for the presidency. In state after state, large majorities of Democratic primary voters - around 60% - said they were 'angry' with the Trump administration, while 30% said they were 'dissatisfied,' according to exit polls by Edison Research. Most of them said they voted for a candidate who they thought could beat Trump. The intensity of Democratic political engagement is part of a broader, tribal mentality of 'negative partisanship' that has been increasingly motivating voters for a half century, said Steven Webster, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. That anger runs both ways, Webster added, saying Trump was very capable of generating enough interest among Republicans over the next several months to nullify any Democratic advantage. Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, noted strong turnout for the president at state Republican primaries this year even though he did not have competition. 'President Trump's supporters would run through a brick wall to vote for him,' Murtaugh said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden's campaign, said he expected this week's endorsements by Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, and Senator Bernie Sanders, his former rival for the nomination, to further energize Democrats. Another sign of Democratic enthusiasm came from Wisconsin where liberal judge Jill Karofsky scored an upset victory over conservative, Trump-backed incumbent Daniel Kelly in a state Supreme Court election in which she won some counties that voted for Trump in 2016. Milwaukee's Janine Hedges, 50, was among thousands who waited in line to vote last week in Wisconsin, which also held a Democratic presidential primary. She cast her ballot for Sanders, who has since suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden. In November, she is ready to wait in line again - for Biden - regardless of the coronavirus. 'We just can't do four more years of this,' she said. 'Even though he is not my first choice, Biden is somebody who has a more benevolent side to him. We need that.'"
"Elizabeth Warren endorsed Joe Biden for president on Wednesday, following Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders as the Democratic Party coalesces around their nominee. 'We're all in this together now,' Warren said in her endorsement. In the video announcing her support, Warren emphasized Biden's empathy, contrasting his leadership style to that of President Donald Trump's. 'Empathy matters,' she said. Biden has rolled out a series of endorsements this week designed to show the Democratic Party united behind him. The messages have similar themes that emphasize Biden's experience and his compassion - giving a marked contrast to President Trump. Warren's message - given from her Massachusetts home and played over images of Biden - touched on Biden's years in public service, his compassion for people and his middle-class up bringing. Warren dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last month but held off on endorsing as Biden and Sanders fought it out. But, on Wednesday, she gave the former vice president her blessing. In her nearly four-minute video, she also made an appeal to liberals, who have been wary about having Biden, a moderate, as their standard bearer. 'Among all the other candidates I competed with in the Democratic primary there is no one I agreed with 100 per cent of the time,' Warren said. 'But one thing I appreciate about Joe Biden is that he always tells you where he stands. When you disagree he'll listen and not just listen but hear you.He will treat you with respect,' she added. She also pointed out that Biden - who endorsed her bankruptcy plan - can be persuaded to other points of view. 'He's shown throughout this campaign that if you come up with facts or a good argument, he’s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded,' Warren said. 'That's the thing about Joe. He wants you in the fight with him. And when you're in the fight with Joe at your side, you know you have a partner who is committed to getting something good done for this country,' she said.'It's up to all of us to help make Joe Biden the next president of the United States. Let's get to work.' Now, with Warren and Sanders endorsing him, Biden has two of the most prominent liberals in the party at his side. Sanders gave Biden his support on Monday. Former President Obama, in his endorsement Tuesday, also emphasized Biden's empathy when he gave him his blessing, an indication of the message the former vice president will offer when he takes his case to the voters. Obama said Biden possessed the right kind of leadership 'the kind of leadership guided by knowledge and experience, honesty and humility, empathy and grace.' 'That kind of leadership doesn'tjust belong in our state capitals and mayors offices, it belongs in the White House,' Obama said. 'And that's why I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States.' 'Because one thing everybody has learned right now is the Republicans occupying the White House and running the U.S. Senate are not interested in progress, they're interested in power,' the former president said. Obama's nod came one day afterSanders made a surprise appearanceon Biden's livestream and endorsed the former vice president, formally making him the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. 'Today I am asking all Americans, I'm asking every Democrat, I'm asking every independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,' Sanders said to Biden on the split-screen, as both men were broadcasting from their homes."
"Former Georgia candidate for governor Stacey Abrams has taken the unusual step of openly touting herself as a potential running mate for former Vice President Joe Biden – saying she would be 'prepared and excited' to serve with him. Abrams, 46, who narrowly lost her bid for governor in 2018 to Republican Brian Kemp, made the unabashed comments to Elle Magazine in an interview. 'Yes. I would be honored,' Abrams told the publication. 'I would be an excellent running mate.' Then, the former Georgia state House minority leader who was the first black woman to be a major party nominee for governor, got into her assessment of her qualifications. She is 30 years Biden's junior, and her ultimately unsuccessful race attracted nationwide enthusiasm from Democrats. 'I have the capacity to attract voters by motivating typically ignored communities. I have a strong history of executive and management experience in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors,' she said. 'I've spent 25 years in independent study of foreign policy. I am ready to help advance an agenda of restoring America's place in the world. If I am selected, I am prepared and excited to serve.' Biden announced at a March presidential debate that he will choose a woman as his running mate. Her pitch got published on a day after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren publicly endorsed Biden with a video shot from her home. It also came amid a series of reports about who Biden might choose, including an outright case for Abrams as a way to provide an enthusiasm boost that appeared in the New York TimesTuesday. Biden is eager to reach out to minority communities who were critical to his success, as well as to the party's left wing that backed rival Bernie Sanders or other candidates. Sanders endorsed Biden Tuesday. Holding back Abrams could be her political resume: she has never held state-wide office or served in Congress. She delivered the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech last year, and founded Fair Fight, a group committed to fair elections, after her opponent purged thousands of voters from the rolls as Georgia secretary of state. 'I've learned that failure is not permanent,' Abrams told the magazine. 'My responsibility is to not let failure dissuade me from my core obligations. Sometimes we pursue a challenge thinking it is about our victory, but we don't know the true purpose until later. Not becoming governor of one state gave me the opportunity to launch a national network in 20 states. The focus on a running mate comes after a former Senate aide accused Biden in interviews of sexually assaulting her in 1993 when he was serving in the Senate. Tara Reade made the claim in interviews, but did not file a police report until last week. A former aide to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has in several media interviews accused him of sexually assaulting her nearly 30 years ago when he was a U.S. senator, an assertion that Biden's campaign has strongly denied. The Biden campaign said the incident 'absolutely did not happen.' Another potential running mate is Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, 48, has issued strict stay-home orders to counter the coronavirus pandemic, and gained national attention by sparring with President Trump.  Presumptive Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden, who has vowed to pick a woman to join his ticket, said he would appoint a committee this month to help him vet possible running mates. The former vice president to Barack Obama has said he would consider six to around a dozen candidates, including several of his former rivals for the party's nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. His plan is to select one well before the Democratic convention in August. Biden, 77, has said the candidate should be someone who could step into the presidency if needed. He also has sought advice from Obama, who formally endorsed Biden on Tuesday. 'He said: 'Look, one of the things that worked for you and me, Joe, was that I tried to find someone who had experiences or capacity that I didn't have,'' Biden said of Obama at a fundraising event last week. 'And so I'm gonna need a woman vice president who has capacities, has strengths, where I have weaknesses.' No woman has ever served as vice president, although two - Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Republican Sarah Palin in 2008 - were major-party nominees for the office. Here are some women who are likely to be considered, according to people familiar with the process. Senator Kamala Harris Biden said he would consider Harris, 55, for the vice presidential position a day after the senator from California ended her own presidential bid in December. Harris, who was friendly with Biden's late son, Beau, is aligned with Biden ideologically and is among the country's most well-known black politicians. A number of advisers have pressed Biden and the campaign to consider Harris seriously because the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants could help bring out the key Democratic constituency of black voters in a close election. Yet several Biden confidants have expressed skepticism about Harris' loyalty, particularly after her cutting criticism of Biden's record on race during an early Democratic presidential debate. Senator Amy Klobuchar The 59-year-old senator from Minnesota defied expectations in the Democratic race with her strong showing in New Hampshire, and her endorsement on the eve of the pivotal Super Tuesday contests on March 3 helped Biden win her home state. Klobuchar pitched voters on pragmatism and her appeal to independents and moderate Republicans, and some Democratic advisers see her adding to Biden's potential appeal to the white working-class voters who voted for Trump in 2016. Picking her as a running mate would be a play to help win important Northern states, including Minnesota, where Democrat Hillary Clinton won by only 1 percentage point in 2016 and which Trump is hoping to flip this year. Still, some Biden advisers view Minnesota as a state that is less critical to their path to victory than some other Midwestern states, including Wisconsin and Michigan. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer Biden said his short list includes Whitmer, 48, who raised her profile as one of the governors confronting a growing coronavirus threat in her home state. But she has also come under fire for a stay-at-home order that some in the state viewed as too restrictive and inconsistently applied. His advisers see Michigan as a critical state and Whitmer as a rising star. She was also one of the first guests on his new podcast, where Biden called her 'one of the most talented people in the country.' Senator Elizabeth Warren Warren, 70, who dropped out of the presidential race in March, was the last woman among the top tier of candidates in a Democratic field that began as the most diverse in history. Warren endorsed her former rival Biden for president on Arpil 15, following his endorsements by Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders. 'In this moment of crisis, it's more important than ever that the next president restores Americans' faith in good, effective government - and I've seen Joe Biden help our nation rebuild,' she wrote in a tweet. Yet Biden has said repeatedly he wants a running mate who is 'simpatico' on policy and strategy. Some Biden allies see that as disqualifying for Warren, given their vast differences on the U.S. military's role in the world and how to revamp the U.S. healthcare system. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham Lujan Grisham, 60, became the first Latina Democratic governor of a state in 2018, after serving three two-year terms in Congress. She was also the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and a vocal opponent of Trump's immigration policies. Biden has been encouraged to consider a running mate who could boost his support among Latino voters, potentially the largest minority voting bloc in the election. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto Cortez Masto, 56, a senator from Nevada, succeeded Democratic Senator Harry Reid, an influential party power broker and Biden supporter. She served two terms as attorney general of Nevada before becoming the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate. A presidential ticket with Cortez Masto could improve Biden's support among Latino voters, who chose Senator Bernie Sanders in the Nevada caucus. Representative Val Demings Biden is also likely to consider Demings, 63, an African-American congresswoman from Florida, a key election battleground, campaign advisers said. Yet while Demings was tapped as one of the managers of the House of Representatives impeachment proceedings against Trump, Democratic advisers said her lower profile may hurt her chances. Former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams In her failed bid to become Georgia's governor in 2018, Abrams, 46, gained a national profile. The African American from the Deep South would likely bring enthusiasm to a ticket with Biden, especially among black voters, but she has minimal executive government experience. Biden has suggested he would consider her as his running mate, but several allies note his stance that the vice president must be ready on 'Day One' to be president. - Reuters"
"Far-right conspiracy theorist and Trump activist Jacob Wohl is being vilified after seemingly switching a career in political smear campaigns to flogging his own fitness programs. The 22-year-old self-styled 'political prodigy', who was charged with a felony last year, became infamous for bungling a series of smear attempts using fake information against the President's political opponents. And now his attempt at a phoenix-like transformation into a fitness guru has been met with ridicule on Twitter. Users poked fun at Wohl's ads which are riddled with typos and which use the coronavirus lockdown as a selling point. 'With millions of people stuck at home during the Covid-19 Pandemic, it's more likely than ever that Summer will sneak up on you and leave you with a sub-par beach physique,' Wohl wrote on his website. 'Thankfully, the Jacob Wohl Summer Physique Accelerator is here.' An earlier version of the hastily-written website read: 'People have watched in real time on Instagram as Jacob Wohl has achieved a stunning physique and incredible strenght [sic] gains in just 100 days. Now the exact fitness and diet plan the [sic] he follows is available to you.' An email advertising his new plan offered subscribers '24/7 support and advice from Jacob Wohl' for $500. But he told vegans and vegetarians they 'need not apply.' 'This program is not designed to work around your eating disorder,' he wrote. The ads prompted responses of 'Are you kidding? Who's getting this???' and 'Seriously WTF is this' from bemused recipients on Twitter. On his website, Wohl claims he was the 'youngest person to ever start a hedge fund.' But his trading got him into trouble when he was charged with a felony in August last year for the unlawful sale of securities. An arrest warrant for Wohl said the charges date back to 2016 when he represented himself to investors as a member of a company called Montgomery Assets. The warrant said he was wanted for offering for sale 'unqualified securities in violation of California Corporations Code 25110.' The Arizona Corporation Commission also ordered Wohl to pay nearly $33,000 in restitution in 2017 for alleged violations of securities law. A commission spokeswoman said in November 2018 he still had not paid any of the fine. In October 2018 Wohl made his big move in his new career as a 'political operative', accusing former FBI chief Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct. Mueller was serving as Special Counsel at the time, conducting an investigation into Russian meddling in the Trump 2016 campaign. The story was first pushed by a mysterious company called Surefire Intelligence. The LinkedIn profile of one purported employee of the firm had a stock photo of a model as their profile picture, and another used a picture of Inglorious Basterds actor Christoph Waltz. Wohl was soon exposed as being behind the suspect company when journalists found he used his email to register the Surefire website domain, and the company's office number directed to his mother's voicemail. Wohl and his business partner, Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman, then held a botched press conference over the sexual misconduct claims in a shabby Holiday Inn, where the alleged victim failed to show up and Burkman gave a speech with his fly undone. Wohl has also unsuccessfully tried to promote a story that former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren had an affair with a 24-year-old bodybuilder Marine. And in another smear attempt, Wohl sought to whip up a sexual misconduct claim against Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, but was caught on an audio recording trying to pressure the supposed victim into making a false allegation. The would-be accuser, Michigan college student Hunter Kelly, had already recanted the claims when Wohl and Burkman held another press conference about their story in Burkman's driveway. The pair wheeled out a television into the front yard with 'PRESS CONFERENCE' on its screen to help add an air of authority to the event. Burkman told DailyMail.com his mission was 'to bring the truth to light', and that in all his cases 'the victim signed a statement before our press conference'. Last year Wohl reported a death threat that he sent himself from a fake Twitter account to Minneapolis police. The self-described 'renegade firebrand' was banned from Twitter for using at least four fake accounts, some of which he admitted to. One of the accounts, 'DrakeHomes612', claimed to be a 'diversity coordinator' in Minneapolis, and sent Wohl a threatening direct message when he visited the city. 'I hope you f**kin know that if [I] bump into you in Dinkytown or anywhere else in my city I'm going shoot you and sh** on your fu**ing bodies,' the account wrote. 'Get that fu** out my city you piece of sh**. Now.' Wohl claimed the message was a 'terroristic threat' and reported it to Minneapolis police. Wohl incorrectly claimed that former presidential candidate Kamala Harris could not run for the office because her parents were not born in the US, and pushed bogus claims that she was raised in Canada rather than Oakland, California. And in one of his most recent press releases, again from the driveway of Burkman's home in Arlington, Wohl attempted to capitalize on the media frenzy around a whistle-blower who reported Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian Prime Minister which led to impeachment proceedings. Before the conference Wohl had promised to reveal the name of the anonymous whistle-blower, but ended up telling his audience that the government had told him not to release it. In a fitting tribute to his largely unsuccessful smear campaigns, one of Wohl's emails promoting his fitness campaign is titled 'Achieving Failure'. 'In the gym, most people will never work hard enough and embrace enough discomfort to achieve failure. At and beyond failure is where progress comes in the gym. In the truest sense, failure produces winning,' he wrote to his potential customers, alongside a picture of him in a green swimsuit looking out to sea. 'If you're ready to have the best beach body of your life, get my 8 Week Summer Fitness Accelerator TODAY.' His pearls of wisdom are prematurely cut short on his website however, where the last sentence introducing his fitness plan reads: 'The proven exercise and diet principles incorporated in the Summer Physique Accelerator create long term success for men and women who want to display the best beach phy'. When asked by DailyMail.com for a response, Wohl said: 'My fitness program is simply the best on the market when it comes to giving people a stunning beach physique in a short amount of time. People have seen it work on me in real time on my Instagram.' He added that he has now dropped his fitness plan price to $200. "
"She has been advocating for prisoners including taking trips to meet with Donald Trump as part of her criminal justice reform projects. And on Tuesday, reality star Kim Kardashian, 39, shared with her social media followers that she has been reading letters from inmates during her coronavirus self-isolation. She showed off some of the envelopes she's received as well as one handwritten note in a since-deleted nine-second video clip on Instagram story. The note from a prisoner let her know they had a release date of May 31, 2024 and they thanked the Keeping Up With The Kardashians castmember, saying: 'You are appreciated.' Kim has been supporting the First Step Act which seeks to reduce the number of people behind bars through sentencing reform. Trump signed the bill into law on December 21. Also Tuesday, Kim took to Twitter and Instagram to push her latest perfume KKW X KRIS that's released Wednesday. She posted a series of images and clips promoting the fragrance inspired by her 64-year-old momager Kris Jenner that's aimed at the Mother's Day market. Kim has been using her time, too, to plug her SKIMS undergarment line and on Monday shared with her fans that her $68 waist trainer is back in stock. Posting a clip showing off her cinched waist while dressed in black active wear, the reality star shared that she wears the product around the house or under a baggy hoodie while running errands. 'I don't feel like I'm suffocating, I don't feel like I can't breathe,' she said. She then pointed her followers to the SKIMS website and emphasizing there is free shipping on purchases totaling $75 or more.  "
"Deputies in Florida have arrested a couple of doctors after they were caught on a doorbell camera stealing a campaign flag supporting President Donald Trump from their neighbor's property in front of their two children. Geoffrey Michael Fraiche, 41, and Laura Ann Webb-Fraiche, 38, allegedly took the flag on April 7 in Gulf Breeze. A Santa Rosa County Sheriff´s report said they used a ladder to pull it down. Both Fraiche and Webb-Fraiche are gynecologists working in different Pensacola hospitals. They were charged with criminal mischief, trespassing, larceny and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and released from the county jail, reported WKRG. The district's Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, who is a loyal Trump supporter, tweeted on Tuesday that their actions showed 'despicable parenting.' He included a version of the Ring camera video with captions added that the couple's older child asked them to stop. As Fraiche sets down his younger child wearing a diaper on the ground and goes to grab the ladder, his son begs him, 'No, don't do it! You're gonna go to jail.' While Fraiche's wife lands him a hand setting up the ladder, their son continues pleading with them: 'stop it! I don't want you two going to jail.' Webb-Fraiche tells the boy not to worry, but he continues begging them to abandon their plan. The father ignores the boy's pleas and ascends the rungs barefoot to tear down the blue 'Trump 2020 Keep America Great' banner. Within seconds, he removes the flag, prompting his overjoyed wife to exclaim, 'Yes, baby, yes!' The family of four then reportedly got in a golf cart and took off. 'Apparently two medical degrees lack the decency & common sense of a child,' Gaetz tweeted in response to the video. The victim of the stunt told deputies that Fraiche caused $500 worth of damage to his flag pole, and the banner itself cost $200. Fraiche is a gynecologist at Sacred Heart Hospital, while his wife is a gynecologist at West Florida Hospital."
"The reason for spring’s unmistakeable earthy odour has been revealed by scientists – and it’s all about reproduction. Geosmin is the chemical that produces the 'earthy' scent of spring and is made by a bacteria calledstreptomyces in the process of attracting a tiny insect called a springtail. Scientists from the John Innes Centre in Norwich discovered the link betweenstreptomyces and springtails through a series of experiments. The team, which included researchers from Sweden, laid traps for the tiny insects using the bacteria as bait and found the springtails were drawn to the streptomyces. They discovered that the bacteria produces the earthy smelling geosmin in a large part to draw in the worms which feed on thestreptomyces. Springtails eat the bacteria and in return are completely covered in its spores - which they gradually drop off as they move through the soil - helping it reproduce. According to the Swedish and British researchers behind the study - streptomyces produce a range of organic compounds including powerful antiobiotics. Lead author Mark Buttner, from the John Innes Centre, wanted to discover what it was that caused the streptomyces to produce the distinctive smelling compound. The symbiotic relationship between the two species dates back more than 450 million years and has been described as a 'seasonal dance'. 'This is analogous to birds eating the fruits of plants,' said Buttner, adding that 'they get food but they also distribute the seeds, which benefits the plants.' The Swedish researchers placed the insects in y-shaped tubes - some containing the bacteria and others with control substances. They also placed electrodes in their antennae to examine their responses to different types of molecules. In both cases they found the insects were powerfully attracted to the smell of the geosmin produced bystreptomyces. The bacteria produces powerful antibiotics that help humans fight off infections but that also routinely kill off fruit flies and nematodes. However, further highlighting the symbiotic relationship, springtails have developed enzymes that detoxify any streptomyces antibiotics. 'There is mutual benefit. The springtails eat the streptomyces, so the geosmin is attracting them to a valuable food source,' said Buttner. 'The springtails distribute the spores, both stuck on their bodies and in their faeces. 'We used to believe streptomyces spores were distributed by wind and water but there is little room for wind or water to do anything in the small air compartments in the soil. 'So these small primitive animals have become important in completing the life cycle of the streptomyces, one of the most important sources of antibiotics known to science.' The findings have been published in the journal Nature Microbiology."
"Clear skies and warm temperatures in 2019 are responsible for the worst year on record for Greenland's vast ice sheet, a study reveals. It also found that atmospheric factors, such as clear skies and high pressure, are currently not included in climate predictions for the future. Therefore, the researchers from Columbia University state, models may be underestimating future melt of theworld's second largest ice sheet by around half. Last year, Greenland ice sheet's mass balance — which accounts for melting and snowfall — increased by only 50 billion tons, 320 billion tons less than the average for 1981-2010. However, when researchers also accounted for ice that calves away and drifts into the ocean, it revealed Greenland's ice sheet lost 600 billion tons in mass. According to the researchers, this is equivalent to a global sea level rise of around 1.5mm. Unusually persistent bouts of high pressure over the country prevented the formation of ice, which led to a decrease in snowfall and an increase in ice melt. The Greenland ice sheet contains enough frozen water to raise sea levels by as much as 23 feet (7m) if it was to disappear entirely. Scroll down for video The study used satellite data, ground measurements and climate models to analyse changes in the ice sheet during the summer of 2019. The scientists compared the data to the average annual surface mass difference between 1981 and 2010, which was a 375 billion ton gain. Previously, the worst year on record was 2012, which experienced a 310 billion ton drop compared to the pre-2010 average. The principle issue last year was the fact Greenland's skies were often clear, and not cloudy, due to persistent area of high pressure. As a result of these so-called anticyclonic conditions, approximately 50billion ton of snow did not fall, the scientists say. The lack of snowfall also left dark, bare ice exposed in some places, and because ice doesn't reflect as much sunlight as fresh snow, it absorbed more heat and exacerbated melting and runoff. 'Imagine this vortex rotating in the southern part of Greenland,' Professor Tedesco explained 'It is literally sucking in like a vacuum cleaner the moisture and heat of New York City, for example, and dumping it in the Arctic - in this case, along the west coast of Greenland. 'When that happened, because you have more moisture and more energy, it promoted the formation of clouds in the northern part.' Surface mass balance takes into account gains in the ice sheet's mass, such as through snowfall, as well as losses from surface meltwater runoff. Professor Tedesco said: 'You can see the mass balance in Greenland as your bank account. In some periods you spend more, and in some periods you earn more. 'If you spend too much you go negative. This is what happened to Greenland recently.' The study, published in the journalThe Cryosphere, shows climate models may be vastly underestimating how much ice will melt in Greenland in the future. According to Dr Tedesco,current global climate models are not able to capturethe effects of a 'wavier jet stream' - a phenomenon that can lead toextreme weather. As a result, he believes simulations of future impacts are significantly underestimating the mass loss due to climate change. He says: 'Because climate models that project the future melting of the Greenland ice sheet do not currently account for these atmospheric patterns, they may be underestimating future melting by about half.' The researchers believe these conditions will become more common in Greenland. Dr Tedesco said: 'These atmospheric conditions are becoming more andmore frequent over the past few decades. 'It is very likely that this is due to the waviness to the jet stream,which we think is related to, among other things, the disappearance ofsnow cover in Siberia, the disappearance of sea ice, and the differencein the rate at which temperature is increasing in the Arctic versus themid-latitudes.' Global sea levels could rise as much as 1.2 metres (4 feet) by 2300 even if we meet the 2015 Paris climate goals, scientists have warned. The long-term change will be driven by a thaw of ice from Greenland to Antarctica that is set to re-draw global coastlines. Sea level rise threatens cities from Shanghai to London, to low-lying swathes of Florida or Bangladesh, and to entire nations such as the Maldives. It is vital that we curb emissions as soon as possible to avoid an even greater rise, a German-led team of researchers said in a new report. By 2300, the report projected that sea levels would gain by 0.7-1.2 metres, even if almost 200 nations fully meet goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Targets set by the accords include cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of this century. Ocean levels will rise inexorably because heat-trapping industrial gases already emitted will linger in the atmosphere, melting more ice, it said. In addition, water naturally expands as it warms above four degrees Celsius (39.2°F). Every five years of delay beyond 2020 in peaking global emissions would mean an extra 20 centimetres (8 inches) of sea level rise by 2300. 'Sea level is often communicated as a really slow process that you can't do much about ... but the next 30 years really matter,' lead author Dr Matthias Mengel, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Potsdam, Germany, told Reuters. None of the nearly 200 governments to sign the Paris Accords are on track to meet its pledges."
"Video has captured the dramatic moment a Maine paper mill was destroyed by a massive explosion. The blast rocked the Androscoggin Mill in the town of Jay Wednesday afternoon, shaking the ground and causing plumes of black smoke to shoot up into the air. Video, recorded by a witness from the inside of a truck, shows debris from the explosion making bullet-like noises as it struck other vehicles in the area. Remarkably, no one was injured in the blast. Emergency responders rushed to the mill, and the state fire marshal planned an investigation. The cause of the blast is not yet clear. The mill, which employs about 500 people, is a key piece of rural Maine's economy. Mill spokesperson Roxie Lassetter said the company was in the preliminary stages of assessing what happened and evaluating the environmental impact. The explosion released a mixture of wood fiber, water and chemicals, and the company is taking steps to restore order to the mill site, Lassetter said. Gov. Janet Mills urged residents to stay far from the scene, issuing an emailed statements asking residents to 'join me in praying for the safety and wellbeing of all those in and around the historic mill.' The mill was built in the mid-1960s in Jay, which today is a community of about 5,000 people.  Maine Senate President Troy Jackson said the state will need to support the community and its workforce in the wake of such a major blow. 'To the 500 mill workers, who showed up to work today expecting it to be an ordinary day, I know that this is devastating and that the next few hours, days and weeks won´t be easy,' he said. The mill had been sold in February by Ohio-based Verso Paper to a specialty paper producer in Pennsylvania. Pixelle Specialty Solutions, of Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, acquired both the Jay mill and another mill in Wisconsin in a $400 million deal. Pixelle said at the time that the deal would make it the largest specialty paper business in the U.S. in terms of annual production. 'We ask for everyone´s continued prayers through this and will update information once it is available. We are also asking that you stay away from the area and allow the crews to work,' said Shiloh LaFreniere, spokeswoman for Pixelle."
"Tammy Turley's heart aches for the thousands of dogs and cats across the country who will likely die by euthanasia in the coming weeks - not because they're sick, but because the COVID-19 pandemic-caused economic meltdown has made them expendable in households that can no longer afford to feed them. 'Families abandon their pets or surrender them to shelters, and when those shelters are overflowing and the pets aren't adopted, that's when they start putting them down,' said Turley, executive director of the Mostly Mutts animal rescue shelter north of Atlanta. Animals who've been abandoned are killed by euthanasia every week even when times are good, but with the current pandemic uncertainty, the untimely deaths are likely to skyrocket, she said. Now Turley is calling for widespread awareness of the need for more foster families to take in the surrendered pets – even temporarily – until a proper adoptive home becomes available. Her no-kill shelter routinely pulls dogs and cats from local animal control shelters and has them examined by veterinarians before they are adopted or placed in foster homes. When the COVID-19 crisis forced her shelter to close because of a state-wide 'work-from-home mandate, she had to quickly find foster homes for more than 70 dogs in a matter of days. 'We had 70 dogs and some cats and kittens in here that were ready to be adopted, but we knew we wouldn't have volunteers to care for them once the 'work-from-home' order was issued,' Turley told DailyMail.com. 'We put the word out on social media and we received 86 offers to foster the pets that day. Our regular fosters are amazing, and all our dogs and cats are safe,' she added. 'But I know more are coming as the economy gets worse. People are scared, and many families see feeding and caring for a pet as an expense they can't afford now -even though that pet may have been a family member for years. It's sad, but that's why our shelter is here. We re-home these pets to families who are able to adopt or at least serve as foster homes until a permanent home can be found.' Turley said a tender goodbye to Osa, a German Shepherd mix that was the last dog in her large shelter to be relocated into a foster home three weeks ago. 'Then it was time to close our doors, at least for a while, because our volunteers were no longer able to come,' she said. Her shelter's kennel spaces are all empty and clean, ready for new occupants. 'As soon as we can reopen we'll start visiting the animal control shelter we routinely work with. They will be filled to capacity as people surrender their pets, even with tears in their eyes. 'As the economy plummets nationwide and fear grows, I think things will get really bad. There will be a huge flood of dogs to re-home – or be put down. 'People are losing their jobs and worried about finances. They struggle to feed their families, so feeding and caring for a pet becomes a luxury. They leave their pets at an animal control shelter and move on with life, surviving these uncertain times,' Turley said. 'If there are more surrendered pets than the humane shelters can accommodate, and shelters like us are at capacity and unable to take any more, that's when the euthanasia ramps up,' she added. 'We only have so many spaces so right now foster families are critical until we get the pets actually adopted.' Fostering the newly surrendered pets helps everyone, according to Turley. 'Now that we're all ordered to stay home, a lot of people are offering to provide foster care. The dog or cat keeps them company while they're confined to working from their homes, and it keeps a shelter kennel open for another dog who comes in.' When Michael Pastorius, 55, Dallas, Georgia, was ordered to work from home three weeks ago, he decided to open his home to Osa. 'I've always been a dog lover, but with my travel schedule I couldn't give a dog the time and care they needed. But I live alone and now I have to work from home, so I could give Osa the attention she needs and I have a companion for four or five weeks. 'We're good company for each other and she won't leave my side, but eventually she'll go to her adopted family. I was glad to help, and I would be very happy to foster another dog if needed,' he told DailyMail.com. Anna Marie Cox, 31, decided to foster parent a young Staffordshire Terrier named Dill Pickle when the coronavirus pandemic forced her massage therapy practice to close in March. 'We had another dog and they were good with each other. My husband and I wanted to relieve the pressure shelters were under, and now that we're home all the time we could love on him and train him before transitioning to his forever home,' she said. 'The fostering saved lives and we've decided he's a perfect fit into our family, so we will officially adopt him. They call that a ''foster fail'' and its very common. I think there will be a lot greater need for fostering in the next few months,' Cox added. 'Can you imagine what it's like to be locked up with most of your normal freedoms removed, uncertain about tomorrow, and in some case, your hours and minutes -controlled by fear of the unknown? Now you can, during the community lockdowns for COVID-19.' Lisa R. Smith, founder of You Lucky Dog Rescue, a Georgia based non-profit said: 'That's the life of a dog in animal control. Dogs are being euthanized. They are really super good loving dogs who need a foster door to open for them so they can get out.' Susan Salzano and her husband Bruce Main have adopted four rescue dogs through the You Lucky Dog agency, and they're ready to take on another one when needed. 'It's all to save a life, and maybe two maybe two,' the 64-year-old Marietta, Georgia resident said. 'She's glad fostering is becoming more popular nationally. It's a great way to really make a difference. You are saving lives when you foster, and you get all this love and companionship,' Smith said. 'While people aren't allowed to physically gather due 'stay in place' orders, we can gather our goodness for change, and foster a shelter dog,' Smith said. 'That's the new rallying cry -- to save the lives of thousands of shelter dogs stuck in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis,' Smith added. "
"The first clip for the long-awaited David Bowie biopic Stardust has been released, and offers a glimpse of Johnny Flynn's performance as the pop music icon. The British film was scheduled to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival, but has been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the clip, Johnny's David doubts whether his third album will be a success in the United States, and seeks reassurance from his publicist Ron Oberman, as the film depicts the eventual birth of his alter-ego Ziggy Stardust. Scroll down for video In the brief clip, David asks Ron whether his record label are supporting the release of his record in the US, with the film taking place in 1971 following his now-iconic album The Man Who Sold The World. David asks Ron: 'Tony said Mercury had doubts about the record. He persuaded them to throw a load of resources behind the tour,' before insisting he doesn't want to appear 'ungrateful.' But Ron tells him: 'The labelhas doubts... but I don't. I think you're going to be the biggest goddamn star in America it's a great record, just no one knows how to sell you in America.' As David questions whether Ron can 'sell him' in the States, he insists: 'Hell yeah I do! Don't get me wrong I'm a f****ng minority to one but all it takes is a believer to change the world and we've got two.If you don't we're really f****d.' In Stardust, Johnny takes on the role of the pop music icon David Bowie, while Marc Maron plays publicist Ron Oberman. The film depicts the pair travelling to the US in 1971, and how their struggle to win over American audiences became the birth of Bowie's iconic alter-ego Ziggy Stardust. Along with his bandJohnny Flynn & The Sussex Wit, Johnny is also known for roles in Lovesick,Genius and most recently the period drama Emma. Despite depicting the early days of Bowie's career, his son Duncan Jones has insisted that the family have no involvement in the making of the film. Bowie died on 10th January 2016 at the age of 69 after battling liver cancer, just two days after the release of his acclaimed album Blackstar. The film has been directed by Gabriel Range, who said in a statement to Variety he was striving to see the story behind one of Bowie's most famous characters. He said: 'I set out to make a film about what makes someone become an artist; what actually drives them to make their art. 'That someone is David Bowie, a man we’re used to thinking about as the star he became, or as one of his alter egos: Ziggy Stardust; Aladdin Zane; The Thin White Duke. 'Someone I only ever saw at a great distance, behind a mask; a godlike, alien presence. Even in his perfectly choreographed death, he didn’t seem like a regular human being.' Stardust was schedule to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival this month, but the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Instead the film will be released online through Film Constellation for press viewing on Wednesday, and a nationwide release date is yet to be confirmed."
"Volvo has become to first car maker to start fitting all of its new models with speed limiters, This is Money can reveal - two years ahead of the market-wide requirement for the safety systems. The Swedish auto brand announced in March 2019 that it would be fitting limiters to all new models in 2020 which would mean none of its new cars would be able to be driven at speeds over 112mph. And it has confirmed this has already started to take place, with vehicles that have come off assembly lines as part of customer orders this year have the technology installed. All new cars built from 2022 will legally be required to have speed limiters - known asIntelligent Speed Assistance systems - fitted. However, Volvo has taken the decision to introduce the technology ahead of the curve as part of efforts to eliminate all road deaths and serious injuries in its vehicles - part of a project it has dubbed 'Vision 2020'. And models already set to be delivered have them installed. A spokesman for the brand told This is Money: 'Everything we do at Volvo starts with safety. 'Above certain speeds, in-car technologies and infrastructure are no longer sufficient to prevent serious injury or fatality if an accident occurs. 'By tackling the issue of speeding in this way, we are addressing what is still a major cause of traffic fatalities.' While the car maker confirms new vehicles built already this year have the limiters installed, it hasn't clarified from what date they were being implemented in its factories. There is also no information on the brand's website to inform potential customers that new cars ordered will have speed limiters. The Scandinavian brand - now owned by Chinese firm Geely - hopes the move to install speed-limiting technology will help to cement its reputation as a worldwide leader in safety with one of the 'most ambitious safety visions in automotive history'. It said speeding is one of the most prominent reasons for road accidents, and the introduction of a built-in speed limiters will help curb the number of deaths caused by drivers travelling excessively fast. It added that a top speed of 112mph was chosen as it balances safety against buyer attitudes, fearing that limiting drivers strictly to national limits would hinder sales volumes. German outfits including BMW and Audi already have speed limiters of 155mph for their mainstream models only - likely a move to handicap motorists using their cars on the unrestricted Autobahns - but not in their high-performance cars. Volvo is the first to have the electronic restrictors across an entire range. It means a car like the flagship XC90 SUV - priced from just under £55,000 has had its top speed trimmed by around 20mph. Speed limiters willbe mandatory across the market from 2022 under proposals from the European Transport Safety Council that received approval by MEPs. These systems - also known as Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) technology - use GPS data and traffic sign recognition cameras to determine what the speed limit is on the the road the car is travelling on. The ISA identifies the speed limit and automatically limits the top speed to match it. However, drivers will be able to override the system by pushing hard on the throttle - just in case they're overtaking another motorist who has decided to put their foot down. Volvo's system is different. It will electronically limit the top speed to 112mph at all times - which is 42mph faster than motorway restrictions in the UK. The only time this will not be the case is if the vehicle is being used by the police, when the limiter will be deactivated, a spokesman confirmed to This is Money last year. Håkan Samuelsson, president and chief executive at the car maker said: 'Volvo is a leader in safety: we always have been and we always will be. 'Because of our research we know where the problem areas are when it comes to ending serious injuries and fatalities in our cars. 'And while a speed limitation is not a cure-all, it’s worth doing if we can even save one life.' As well as limiting top speeds, the company is investigating how a combination of smart speed control and geofencing technology could automatically limit speeds around schools and hospitals in the future. New cars sold from 2021 will also have a new 'Care Key' with additional speed limits. This is an extra spare key for the vehicle that can have a pre-loaded lower top speed of less than 112mph activated for the car when this specific fob is in use. That means owners of Volvos will be able to lend their vehicles to their teenage children who might have only recently passed their test in the knowledge that they can go no faster than a top speed determined by the parent. 'We want to start a conversation about whether car makers have the right or maybe even an obligation to install technology in cars that changes their driver´s behaviour, to tackle things like speeding, intoxication or distraction,' Mr Samuelsson added. 'We don’t have a firm answer to this question, but believe we should take leadership in the discussion and be a pioneer.' On top of limiters, the other facet of the Vision 2020 project is the introduction of new technology to defeat two other major causes of accidents - intoxication and distraction. To do so, Volvo also plans to fit new models within-car cameras and sensors to monitor driving behaviour. If the technology measures that a user is unfit to be at the wheel or driving erratically it will alert them and prompt the motorist to pull over. And in the most extreme cases the technology built into Volvo cars will be able to safely bring the vehicle to a halt automatically to prevent the user causing an accident. Volvo is also pushing motorists to consider alternative fuel models in its range by first introducing customers in showrooms and online to plug-in variants of its car before petrol and diesel-powered examples."
"A new study on neutrinos, a mysterious subatomic particle thought to have been present during the Big Bang, suggests they played a critical role in solidifying matter's prevalence over antimatter. According to the study, published in the journal Nature, a discrepancy in the creation of muon neutrinos over their antineutrino counterparts may shed light on why the universe permeated with matter instead of antimatter - a mystery known as the thebaryon asymmetry. Specifically, the baryon asymmetry focuses on how matter came to be prevail over antimatter despite the fact that when the two collide, both are eliminated. In theory, this mutual annihilation should mean neither matter nor antimatter should have survived the Big Bang. To understand the mystery behind this asymmetry, scientists have turned to the T2K experiment - a collaboration between 500 international scientists that employs, among other things, a proton accelerator in Japan that fires neutrino beams into what's known as the Super-Kamiokande. Here scientists can gauge a phenomenon known as oscillation - when a neutrino changes its 'flavor' spontaneously into one of three different types of neutrino. Specifically, the test was designed to ascertain the rate at which muon neutrinos shift their form, called oscillation, and form into electron neutrinos or electron antineutrinos. As noted by Science, after a decade of firing trillions of muon neutrinos at the target, scientists tallied90 electron neutrinos and 15 electron antineutrinos. The results suggest that neutrinos turn into electron neutrinos at a higher rate than their antineutrino counterparts and as a result, would propagate regular matter at a higher rate than antimatter. Scientists say their results aren't completely definitive, but are significant enough to challenge principals of physics like charge parity (CP) which dictates that physics should look the same whether you substitute particles for antiparticles - a principle that would forecast the same amount of matter and antimatter in the universe. As noted by Science, the studyrules out the possibility that there was no CP violation in the early creation of matter at a 95 percent confidence level which is less than the 99.7 percent threshold needed to claim 'strong evidence.' According to Science, rival experiments like called NuMI Off-Axis ν which is located in Minnesota, have come up with conflicting results, ruling there was almost no CP violation, though tests scheduled for later this decade could help resolve those discrepancies. The sterile neutrino is a hypothetical fourth type of neutrino. So far, there are three known types of neutrinos, known as 'favours'. These are muon, electron, and tau. A fourth type would have mass – different from the others – and interact with gravity. Studies have suggested it can be 'caught' by observing its influence on the other types of neutrinos. Most recently, researchers working on the MiniBooNE (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment) in Chicago believe they observed neutrinos oscillating into sterile neutrinos, and then back to particles in the detectable realm. If discovered, the sterile neutrino could help to explain the mysterious origins of dark matter, and even resolve issue of the universe's matter and antimatter imbalance."
"Blac Chyna has refused to go without her glam squad during the coronavirus lockdown in LA and is having her beauty entourage quarantine with her, DailyMail.com has learned. The 31-year old model and entrepreneur was spotted out and about on Tuesday, accompanied bytwo men who work for her Lashed Cosmetics line, both wearing 'Lashed' logo shirts. 'While the rest of us can't get to our regular beauty appointments thanks to the economic shutdown, Chyna was flaunting some impressive pink stiletto nails,' a source told DailyMail.com.'She's got this quarantine thing right. Locked down with beauty experts!' The mother-of-two was making a quick trip to a bank near her $3 million Woodland Hills, California home, but when she emerged from the building, she was crying and arguing with someone on the phone. The day before, Chyna was slammed online for charging fans $950 for a video chat on FaceTime with her and $250 for a follow-back on Instagram, even offeringfour interest-free installments for those who can't afford to pay it all upfront. Chyna was seen on Tuesday morning dressed in a Defy Sporting Goods 'anti-rip' romper and a Lumi Luxury Chanel inspired rabbit fur fanny pack. She had to wait her turn outside the bank due to mandatory social distancing rules, sitting on a curb as she waited to enter, photos show. Abiding by Los Angeles County orders, she had to put on a mask before entering the building. Despite seeming fine before entering the bank, 'when she left she was arguing loudly with someone on her iPhone, she even had tears coming down her face,' the source said. They added: 'Whoever Chyna was yelling over the phone at as she left the bank was getting an earful. She may be small but she is fierce!' On Monday, fans were outraged when details of Chyna's new money-making venture emerged on her website, and they didn't hold back in the comments section of her Instagram. 'Who tf you think you is tryna charge these naive folks for a follow back,' came one comment. 'Is u going broke. 250 for a follow back tf wrong wit u' one person wrote. Also on Monday, it was reported that her ex Rob Kardashian and father of her three-year-old daughter Dream filed court papers in which he claimed she threatened him with a gun on multiple occasions when they were together. The couple starred in just one season of their highly rated E! reality show Rob & Chyna, which chronicled her pregnancy and his battle with weight and depression. She also has son King Cairo, 7, with rapper Tyga, 30, who dated Rob's sister Kylie Jenner. Rob, 33, alleged in court papers one of the incidents occurred when she had consumed drugs and alcohol. He then chronicled what he claims was her attempt to strangle him with an iPhone charger. The papers claim: 'When he left to lock himself in the master bedroom, he says his then fiancée broke the door and 'proceeded to use her fists and metal rod to repeatedly strike [him].' Rob's attorney added in the court documents: 'Chyna's erratic conduct under the influence of alcohol and drugs culminated in her physically assaulting and battering Rob and causing significant property damage.' However, Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani has denied the claims. She said in a statement: 'There was no 'violent attack'. Instead, the evidence shows that Rob and Chyna, a very happily engaged couple at the time, had a raucous and flirty time together on December 14, 2016 to celebrate the worldwide announcement that Season 2 of their #1 rated hit reality TV show Rob & Chyna had been greenlit by the E! network. 'Part of that raucous and flirty celebration included Chyna ripping her fiancé Rob’s shirt and then playfully stroking her fingernails against his chest. Far from being 'assault and battery,' Rob instead admitted under oath at his deposition that being scratched by a woman is 'one of the best things a man could ask for'. 'Rob also admitted that he never feared for his life and actually thought it was 'funny' when Chyna teased him while holding Rob’s unloaded gun. Two years later, Rob is simply trying to cover up his critical deposition admissions by now lying and claiming that Chyna 'pulled a gun' on him and that he feared for his life. That is just another one of Rob’s lies.' "
"Stanford and Fitbit are joining forces in a bid to develop technology that detects early signs of the coronavirus using wearables. The team is designing an algorithm that measures the wearer's vitals such as heart rate and skin temperature to determine if the body is fighting an infection. The software will be capable of spotting unusual patterns, allowing it to predict if the user has contracted an illness before they show physical symptoms. Stanford Medicine researchers have partnered with Fitbit and Scripps Researcher to roll out the technology in bid to help treat illnesses, such as the coronavirus, before the wearer's symptoms become apparent. Scroll down for video Michael Snyder, PhD, professor and chair of genetics at the Stanford School of Medicine, said: 'Smartwatches and other wearables make many, many measurements per day — at least 250,000, which is what makes them such powerful monitoring devices.' 'My lab wants to harness that data and see if we can identify who's becoming ill as early as possible — potentially before they even know they're sick.' Fibit is set to invite users to participate in the researcher in order to help train the algorithm to spot signs of an infection. And the Google-owned firm will also provide researchers with 1,000 smartwatches for the project. As part of this collaboration, scientists at Scripps Research will also work with Fitbit to try to track how infection spreads in a community. The team hopes that by collecting data from thousands of users, the algorithm will ultimately help people monitor their health by alerting them when their heart rate, skin temperature or some other part of their physiology signals that their body is fighting an infection. 'You might wonder, ""Are these sniffles allergies, or am I getting sick?"" These algorithms could help people determine if they should stay home in case their body is fighting off an infection,' Snyder said. For this study, Snyder will gather data from five different wearable devices, including smart rings and other smartwatch brands. Those participating in the researcher will be asked to fill out surveys that track their health status. Altogether, the group will design five algorithms tailored to each different wearable. But Snyder notes that the timeline of developing the technology will greatly depend on the number of people who sign up for the study. Although using algorithms to monitor the wearer's health could be valuable, Snyder has acknowledged there will be obstacles. 'It's possible that the algorithms could detect an elevated heart rate, but the user could be watching a scary movie or participating in some other activity that naturally elevates heart rate,' he said. 'An alert isn't a direct diagnosis, and it will be important for folks to be able to contextualize their situation and use some common sense.' Snyder also adds that even as his team works to develop algorithms that can flag illness, the next step is to investigate whether those signals can be sorted to be able to differentiate between viruses. The coronavirus began in Wuhan, China December 2019 and has infected nearly every country in the world. However, the US has been hit the hardest with over 588,000 cases and more than 23,000 deaths reported. And Stanford and its team hopes their algorithms could help limit the spread and curb the number of deaths by detecting the virus and other infections before the person takes a turn for the worst."
"Billy McFarland, the convicted organizer of the failed Fyre Festival, is making a bid to get out of prison early due to coronavirus concerns at his Ohio prison. Lawyers for McFarland recently requested their client be granted a 'compassionate release', and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence in 'home detention' rather than continue at the Elkton Federal Correctional Facility. The attorneys say in a letter to a judge that 36 inmates and 26 staff members have been confirmed to have the virus and that four prisoners have died. The lawyers also note that Republican Congressman Bill Johnson of Ohio has called the jail a 'breeding ground for the virus.' There have been 7,543 confirmed cases in Ohio of the coronavirus, which has been blamed for 334 deaths. Across the country, there have been 633,380 confirmed cases of COVID-19, which has been blamed for 27,613 deaths. McFarland, 28, is currently serving six years behind bars for fraud after he conned people out of millions to fund fake music festival Fyre Festival in 2017. In addition to the risks of being around anyone who may be infected with COVID-19, McFarland's lawyers say that he has asthma In addition to the risks of being around anyone who may be infected with COVID-19, McFarland's lawyers say that he has pre-existing health issues, including asthma which he suffered as a teenager, plus allergies and 'heart issues since his early 20s.' In addition to the risks of being around anyone who may be infected with COVID-19, McFarland's lawyers say that he has pre-existing health issues, including asthma which he suffered as a teenager, plus allergies and 'heart issues since his early 20s.' The lawyers note that rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine was given similar consideration and released to home detention, due to similar concerns and asthma. Tekashi, 23, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, is currently serving a 24-month sentence after pleading guilty to nine charges including conspiracy to murder and armed robbery. He had already served 13 months of his two-year sentence in jail, and he was due to be released from an upstate New York prison in August 2020. However, he was granted April 2 after his lawyers say he was diagnosed with bronchitis and sinusitis late last year and had been hospitalized to treat both ailments. Additionally, attorney Lance Lazzaro said that Hernandez had been experiencing shortness of breath and was not being allowed to see a doctor by prison officials. Considering the rapper's release, McFarland's lawyers say their client is 'ideal candidate for compassionate release,' and that he already was on track for possible home confinement release in 2021. Earlier this month, MacFarland launched a coronavirus-related non-profit from his prison cell, but admitted that: 'If I were you, I'd think this is a scam and I'm full of s**t'. The inmate announced the business venture, known as Project-315, in a rambling Instagram post April 3, seeking toconnect inmates with their families during the outbreak. 'Today I'm launching Project-315, an initiative to help bring together and connect in-need federal inmates and their families who have been affected by the Coronavirus,' he wrote in the long letter, also posted on the non-profit's website.

"A GOP congressman for Indiana has said that letting Americans die to re-open the economy during the coronavirus pandemic is the 'lesser of two evils' when compared with the economy failing. Republican Representative Trey Hollingsworth, of Indiana's ninth congressional district, made the comments during a radio appearance on Tuesday. 'It is policymakers' decision to put on our big boy and big girl pants and say it is the lesser of these two evils,' he told Indiana radio station WIBC-FM. Re-opening the economy 'is not zero evil,' he said, 'but it is the lesser of these two evils and we intend to move forward that direction. 'That is our responsibility and to abdicate that is to insult the Americans that voted us into office.' Hollingsworth joins a group of people that include U.S. President Donald Trump that have said publicly they are willing to ignore expert advice and send people back to work during the crisis. 'There is no zero harm choice here. We are going to have look Americans in the eye and say ""we are making the best decisions for the most Americans possible"" and the answer to that to get Americans back to work, to get Americans back to their businesses,' Hollingsworth said. However, medical experts including America's foremost expert on infectious diseases Dr Anthony Fauci who has spoken numerous times during Trump's daily coronavirus briefings, say that it would be too early. 'I'll guarantee you, once you start pulling back there will be infections,' Fauci said. He has emphasized that only the virus dictates the timeline in which people can return to work. Hollingsworth said that while he understands what scientists are saying, he is also listening to what the social scientists are saying. 'The social scientists are telling us about the economic disaster that is going on. Our GDP is supposed to be down 20% alone this quarter,' he said. 'We’ve got to get Americans back to work, back to their schools, and back to their churches. That’s where they want to be when I talk to them every single day.' Hollingsworth is not the first Republican to make statements similar to this in defiance of medical experts. In addition to Trump, who has said on Monday he would 'soon' release guidance to governors on reopening the economy, on March 23 Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick suggested Americans would be willing to risk their live to go back to work. Speaking to Fox New, he said: 'No one reached out to me and said, ""As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for its children and grandchildren?"" If that is the exchange, I'm all in.' The governor's remarks drew strong criticism from Democrats. The next day, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has been widely praised for his response to the virus in his state, said: 'My mother is not expendable.' In a more measured statement from Hollingsworth's office, provided to CNN later on Tuesday, the Republican said: 'It's hyperbolic to say that the only choices before us are the two corner solutions: no economy or widespread casualties. 'We can use the best of biology and economics to enable as much of the economy to operate as possible while we work to minimize disease transmission.' According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, Indiana has had 8,527 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 387 deaths. In total, the US has had more cases and deaths than any other country, with 615,183 cases and 26,094 deaths."
"TheWWE is releasing several wrestlers and producers, including Hall of Famer Kurt Angle, to reduce payroll despite Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's recent decision to deem the wrestling circuit 'essential,' allowing it to hold live shows in the state amid the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. 'Due to COVID-19 and current government mandated impacts on WWE and the media business generally, the Company went through an extensive evaluation of its operations over the past several weeks,' read a WWE statement. 'This analysis resulted in the implementation of various short-term cost reductions and cash flow improvement actions.' The WWE announced various moves to cut costs and improve cash flow, including: reducing the salaries of executives and board members; decreasing operating expenses; cutting talent expenses, third party staffing and consulting; and deferring spending on the construction of the company's new headquarters for at least six months. Multiple reports have claimed that DeSantis's decision prevented the WWE from breaching its media contracts with NBCUniversal and Fox, but aWWE spokesman did not immediately return the Daily Mail's request for comment on the matter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS The released wrestlers and producers who were released are Angle, Drake Maverick (real name James Curtin), Curt Hawkins (Brian Myers), Karl Anderson (Chad Allegra), Luke Gallows (Drew Hankinson), Heath Slater (Heath Miller), Eric Young (Jeremy Fritz), Rowan (Joseph Ruud), Sarah Logan (Sarah Rowe), Mike Chioda, Mike Kanellis (Mike Bennett), EC3 (Michael Hutter), Aiden English (Matthew Rehwoldt), Lio Rush (Lionel Green), Primo (Edwin Colon) and Epico (Orlando Colon Nieves). 'We wish them all the best in their future endeavors,' read the WWE statement. Angle, 51, had been in semi-retirement, working back stage as a producer following his final match at WrestleMania 35 last year. He was previously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame and prior to becoming a stage wrestler, actually won Olympic gold wrestling at the 1996 Atlanta Games. He thanked the WWE and its fans on Twitter. 'I wanted 2 say thank you to the WWE for the time I spent there.I made many new friends and had the opportunity to work with so many talented people,' he wrote. 'To the Superstars, continue to entertain the WWE Universe as well as you possibly can. They're the best fans in the world.' The moves comes after DeSantis's controversial decision to allow live WWE events in the state despite the risk of perpetuating the coronavirus outbreak. Pro sports were added to a list of businesses permitted to stay open in an April 9 memorandum to include 'employees at a professional sports and media production with a national audience ... only if the location is closed to the general public.' The amendment allows WWE, run by McMahon in the Orlando area, to continue putting on shows - without fans. DeSantis, a Republican, said at a news conference Tuesday that people are 'champing at the bit' for new entertainment to boost morale while housebound. He also would like to see other sporting events, maybe NASCAR races without an audience or a redo of the Tiger Woods-vs.-Phil Mickelson golf match. 'If you think about it, we've never had a period like this in modern American history where you've had such little new content, particularly in the sporting realm,' the Governor said. DeSantis's decision has been slammed nationally by those accusing the Governor of providing a favor to the McMahons, a prominent republican couple that has raised money for President Donald Trump's re-election campaign in the state of Florida. The WWE had produced a pair of pre-taped broadcasts without a live audience in recent weeks, but abandoned plans to tape more programing going forward, instead opting for live shows. That decision was driven by the bottom line, according to Forbes, which cited a WrestlingInc.com report claiming that the WWE's media rights contract with NBCUniversal and Fox mandates that the WWE produce live events on 49 of 52 weeks a year. Failure to do so, according to multiple reports, would result in a breach of contract and could jeopardize the WWE's estimated $400 million per-year media revenue. Vince McMahon's wife Linda, who previously lost a pair of US senatorial campaigns in Connecticut, recently donated $18.5 million through her pro-Trump Super Pac to help the President's re-election efforts in Florida. DeSantis, a staunch Trump supporter, has been accused of rewarding McMahon with a political favor that could help her husband's WWE avoid hundreds of millions in losses. 'DeSantis grants this favor, which will save WWE millions, as Linda McMahon announces that her Super Pac is dropping $18.5 million dollars into Florida for Trump reelection,' tweeted The Nation's sports editor Dave Zirin. 'What a bunch of bottom feeders. 'The timeline for the last week in WWE is ugly as sin,' Zirin wrote in a separate tweet. 'Named an 'essential business' by DeSantis the day Linda McMahon drops $18.5 million into the lap of Florida GOP, then Vince puts his workers at risk for COVID-19 to protect his TV deals, and now layoffs. McMahon Family Values.' Not everyone was upset with DeSantis's decision, however. 'Liberals are mad because we get to keep watching Pro Wrestling thanks for Linda McMahon and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who deemed Pro Wrestling Essential!' wrote DC Patriot founder Matt Couch on Twitter. 'Smells like Winning to me!'"

"Hollywood superstar Matt Damon has delighted locals by isolating in a small Irish town with his family after being caught up in Ireland's coronavirus lockdown. The Bourne Identity star, 49, was filming Ridley Scott epic The Last Duel when lockdown began and amid the travel ban, is now isolating in seaside resort Dalkey, an affluent suburb of Dublin with his wife and four children. Before lockdown began in Ireland on March 27, the Oscar winner was snapped posing outside a cafe and in a restaurant with fans, as well as going swimming near Dalkey with his clothes in a bag from Irish grocery store SuperValuIRL. One fan tweeted: 'Matt Damon going swimming near #Dalkey with his togs in a SuperValuIRL bag - fitting right in!' Another wrote: 'Matt Damon ( huge fan) in Dalkey with a Supervalue bag made my day. Just speaks to how human we all are. This virus has no selectivity, does not discriminate and affects us all over the world. I hope Matt is enjoying his stay here.' The star, worth an estimated $160million, has also reportedly been seen jogging around Dalkey. Matt visited the Corner Note Cafe with his family on March 15 and happily posed for a photo with waitress Mary Caviston. She told the Irish Mail On Sunday she was 'surprised' when she realised the man at table 92 was the Hollywood icon. She said: 'He came in at about 9.30 on a Sunday morning. It was 15 March so just two days before we went into lockdown. 'He was with his wife and his beautiful children, there were six of them in total, he was the last in and he was wearing a baseball cap, and I did catch the American accent but other than that he was just like any other customer. 'He had a beautiful family. They were all impeccably mannered, so polite, unassuming just really lovely people.' On March 22, the down-to-earth star also posed for snaps with staff at steak and seafood eaterie Ouzos in Dalkey. The restaurant wrote: 'Thanks to @matt_damon_official for dropping into Ouzos Dalkey, Dublin, Ireland to approach our owner, @hicham_raouf_ to discuss his idea for another film here in Ireland. Ouzos’ 2!! The Last Duel,adapted from a historical novel by Matt and Ben Affleck, also stars Adam Driver. The movie marks the first return of Matt's writing partnership with Ben Affleck since their award-winning script for Good Will Hunting. MailOnline has contacted Matt's representatives for comment. Last month, Matt joined his co-stars of the 2011 virus thriller Contagion - a prescient film these days - for a series of public service announcements to warn about COVID-19. Matt , Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Ehle have teamed up with scientists from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health to offer four individual homemade videos with advice and a message of unity. Contagion, directed by Steven Soderbergh, explores a scenario in which a lethal and fast-moving influenza is spreading around the world. Damon in his video notes that it is 'creeping it's way up the charts on iTunes, for obvious reasons.' The actor, who in the film played a character who was immune to the hypothetical virus, also stresses listening to experts and staying 6 feet apart. 'That was a movie. This is real life,' he says. 'I have no reason to believe that I'm immune to COVID-19. And neither do you.' The PSAs were written by the film's screenwriter, Scott Z.

"The U.S. Navy has removed 116 medical staff members from its hospital ship docked off Los Angeles after seven crew members tested positive for the coronavirus, an official said on Tuesday. The personnel from the USNS Mercy were taken to a nearby base and remain under quarantine.None so far have needed hospitalization, said Lieutenant Rochelle Rieger of the 3rd Fleet, who added that it's unclear where or how the sailors became infected. Rieger initially said 126 medical crew members were taken off the ship but later corrected the number to 116. The ship left San Diego on March 23 when all staff were screened before they boarded, the lieutenant said. It arrived at Los Angeles four days later to provide relief to the city amid the pandemic by accepting patients from hospitals who were not infected with the virus. None of the more than 1,000 personnel aboard were allowed to leave the ship once it departed San Diego. 'The only people going on and off the ship are the actual patients we've been treating so it's very hard to trace where this came from,' Rieger said. The first case emerged last week as the ship was preparing to receive elderly patients from a skilled nursing facilities in Los Angeles to protect them from being exposed to the virus. So far the ship, with 1,000 beds, has taken in only 20 patients from hospitals and none have tested positive for the coronavirus or showed any symptoms of the illness, Rieger said. Two medical personnel from the ship who tested positive came in close contact with a small number of the patients but they were wearing full protective gear, including gloves, N95 masks and eye goggles. Rieger said the removal of the 116 crew members will not affect the ship's ability to treat patients. The Navy is also planning to send some of its staff who have been screened and completed a 14-day self-quarantine period to work at Los Angeles medical facilities, but that is yet to happen. The Navy has strictly followed the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for hospitals, Rieger said. It also has done deep cleaning of the ship, including sanitizing spaces where any of the infected staff may have been. Those on board are practicing social distancing as best as possible, and the Navy has added tables to its flight deck to allow people to go up top to eat when mess decks become too crowded. Meanwhile, three medical staff members who had tested positive for the virus aboard the USNS Comfort hospital ship that is docked in New York City returned to work. A fourth crew member who also was infected is still recovering. Unlike the Mercy, the Comfort is treating COVID-19 patients on board as well as patients who do not have the virus. The ship has treated more than 120 people since it arrived on March 30, and about 50 of those have been discharged, said Lieutenant Mary Catherine Walsh. The ship removed half of its 1,000 beds so it could isolate and treat coronavirus patients. The Navy has struggled to contain the virus once it comes aboard a ship. About 12 percent of sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier with a crew that has largely been moved ashore in Guam, are infected with the virus. On Monday, the Roosevelt reported its first death, a sailor who had tested positive for the coronavirus on March 30. A second sailor from the aircraft carrier has since been taken into intensive care. Nearly 600 crew members (around 12 percent) from the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive to COVID-19 since initial cases were confirmed on March 24. The ship was thrust into the international spotlight when its captain, Brett Crozier, was relieved of his command by the Navy on April 2 after he sounded the alarm over the outbreak on board his ship. Crozier had sent a letter to Navy bosses pleading to let his sailors off the carrier, fearing that up to 50 of his 4,800 strong crew could die from the virus. Despite firing Crozier for breaking the chain of command, the Navy conceded to his demands for mass testing and a wide scale evacuation of the ship. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe life-threatening illness, including pneumonia. Los Angeles County public health authorities have reported more than 9,400 virus cases and 320 deaths, while in total the U.S. has now seen a total of 615,183 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and 26,094 deaths."
"General Motors Co has said it will deliverits first batch of 600 ventilators to FEMA this week for hospitals in Indiana and Illinois. CEO Mary Barra toldNBCstaff at their plant inKokomo, Indiana have been working 'virtually around the clock, 20-hour days, to make sure we can start building ventilators as quickly as possible'. Barra said the delivery of600 ventilators this month is ahead of schedule. GM, which is working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems to produce the medical equipment, said it expected to fill nearly half the order by the end of June and the full order by the end of August. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded nine contracts totaling nearly $2.6 billion to produce 137,000 ventilators by the end of 2020 for the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. That included the contract to GM worth $489.4 million for the 30,000 ventilators after President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act. White House adviser Peter Navarro said that 'as these lifesaving ventilators roll off GM's assembly line as fast as tanks once did in an earlier World War, they will be rapidly deployed.' GM Chairman and CEO Barra added: 'Thousands of men and women at GM, Ventec, our suppliers and the Kokomo community have rallied to support their neighbors and the medical professionals on the front lines of this pandemic. 'Everyone wants to help turn the tide and save lives. It is inspiring and humbling to see the passion and commitment people have put into this work.' Navarro added: 'GM has moved swiftly in Trump time to manufacture one of the most critical lifesaving devices in America's war against the coronavirus. 'GM's rapid mobilization of America's manufacturing might in defense of our country is a proud salute to the ingenuity of its engineers, the true grit of its UAW workers on the line, and America's doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals fighting for our lives at the front lines.' 'Until there is a vaccine, critical care ventilators give medical professionals the tools they need to fight this pandemic and save lives,' said Ventec Life Systems CEO Chris Kiple. 'This partnership is an historic effort and a great reminder of what can be accomplished with the power of American innovation and American manufacturing skill uniting together around a singular mission to save lives.' GM's shares closed flat. The stock has fallen more than 37 per cent this year, as coronavirus-related lockdowns weigh on automobile sales. Other contracts announced by HHS in recent days include a $646.7 million contract to Dutch health technology company Philips and others to General Electric Co, Hill-Rom Holdings Inc, Medtronic Plc , ResMed Inc, Vyaire Medical Inc, Hamilton Medical AG and Zoll Medical Corp. Hamilton is receiving a $552 million contract for 14,115 ventilators, while Vyaire is receiving a $407.9 million contract for 22,000 ventilators produced by June 29 and Zoll is receiving a $350.1 million contract for 18,900 ventilators, HHS said on Monday. HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement the contracts 'will mean we have more capacity to respond to the pandemic as it evolves.' "
"More than 600,000 have signed a petition demanding the government give hazard pay to all of its USPS workers continuing to brave the outside during the coronavirus lockdown. It comes as 19 postal workers have died of coronavirus, while 500 have tested positive and another 6,000 have had to self-isolate, USPS leaders told Congress last week. The petition claims that USPS staff have not been given adequate protective equipment as they work 12-hour overtime shifts, packing and loading potentially contaminated packages and letters. 'As of this present time, there have been upwards of more than 40 confirmed cases of coronavirus within the United States Postal Service,' the Change.org petitionwritten on March 16 says. 'Megan Brennan USPS CEO hasn't sent any supplies such as had sanitizer or mask for employees protection, she made a very vague statement which basically read her employees should follow CDC guidelines.' A spokesman for USPS said that the petition was exceedingly outdated and much had changed at the agency since it was written. USPS employs some 600,000 staff and last Thursday Brennan asked lawmakers for another $50 billion in addition to a $10 billion loan already sanctioned by Congress last month. 'We are at a critical juncture in the life of the Postal Service,' Brennan told The Washington Post. 'At a time when America needs the Postal Service more than ever, the reason we are so needed is having a devastating effect on our business.' It comes after staff at delivery titans UPS and FedEx said they were being kept in the dark about COVID-19 cases among their colleagues despite the deaths of three workers in a week. Two dozen employees spoke with NBC Tuesday, accusing bosses of a 'frustrating lack of communication with front-line employees' that has caused widespread 'fear and anxiety' in the workforce. UPS and FedEx are America's two largest corporate delivery companies, employing a combined total of 600,000 people. A large majority of employees are deemed 'essential workers', meaning that they continue to perform their duties despite the current pandemic. However, both companies have confirmed that they have employees who have passed away from COVID-19. Last week, FedEx announced that one of its company pilots, 32-year-old Paul Fox, had died from the virus. UPS also acknowledged that two employees at their Worldport facility in Louisville, Kentucky had also succumbed to the disease. Long-time UPS workerRoml Ellis, 55, passed away on April 4. The company confirmed that a second employee from the facility died April 10. The deaths have rattled co-workers at Worldport, who say they learned of Ellis' death from TV news. 'It was all hush-hush. The only reason we got the full details was because it was reported on the local news station,' one stated. 'How are any of us supposed to get ahead of a virus when we don't even know who's sick?' another frustrated UPS worker added. The workers claim they repeatedly asked bosses about their sick co-workers, but management refused to provide any details citing 'privacy concerns'. However, staff at Worldport say they need to know basic details for their own health and safety. 'We don't want to know people's names, but we do want to know if we were working in direct contact with somebody who's contagious,' one told NBC. 'All we get from the supervisors is 'the only thing we know is what management tells us.' Workers at Worldport say they were only provided with masks after Ellis passed away. They also allege that areas of their sprawling facility are 'not disinfected consistently'. Meanwhile, FedEx and UPS employees are 'still working in close proximity to one another' 'in the bellies of planes, in delivery trucks and in warehouses'. On April 9, it was reported that 16 FedEx pilots have tested positive for COVID-19. The company told NBC it has employees who have been diagnosed 'across the enterprise', but would not disclose the number. Similarly, UPS would not tell the news network how many of its workers had tested positive to the virus. DailyMail.com has reached out to both delivery companies for comment. In a statement, UPS told DailyMail.com: 'UPS is saddened by the loss of our employees at Worldport, and we extend our deepest condolences to their families and friends.' 'When UPS learns of a COVID-19 positive case, we inform co-workers in their immediate work area that a case exists, without disclosing the individual identity of the ill employee due to healthcare privacy concerns. 'We are disclosing the incidents to co-workers who need to know because of their potential contact with the ill employee, however we do not communicate site-wide those instances of a diagnosis, as this is beyond the scope of guidance provided by public health officials.' The NBC report comes as the coronavirus pandemic worsens across much of the United States. More than 600,000 Americans have tested positive to the disease, and 25,000 have died. "
"Four U.S. sailors that were assigned to a French aircraft carrier that has been hit by a coronavirus outbreak have been placed in quarantine in France, it has emerged. Two of them have tested positive for the virus, according to the U.S. Navy. French flagship carrier, the Charles De Gaulle, has around 2,100 sailors on board that are being evacuated and isolated. It comes after 'at least 40' cases of the coronavirus were detected following NATO training exercises in Denmark alongside British armed forces. 'Two of four U.S. Sailors assigned to the French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles de Gaulle (R91) tested positive for COVID19 and are receiving excellent host nation medical care at French facilities,' a Navy spokesman told CNN in a statement. It was not previously public knowledge that U.S. military personnel were on board the ship, but it is common for them to serve on allied ships in order to bolster relationships between allied forces. The four sailors are taking part in the US Navy's Personnel Exchange program in which U.S. sailors and personnel are integrated with French and other foreign crews' daily operations, including medical care if required, according to CNN. The exchange program is designed to 'foster strong relationships and enhanced communication with partners and allies.' TheCharles De Gaulle often works along-side the U.S. and other nation's armed forces. Itplayed a significant part in the bombing campaign against ISIS in the Middle East. The battleship, one of the largest in the world, reportedly arrived at its home port of Toulon in Southern France on Sunday at around 3pm local time after undertaking exercises in Denmark. The vessel cut short its current mission in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic by 10 days because of the outbreak. Coronavirus cases were detected on board, and the nuclear powered ship made an urgent dash for the Mediterranean to get home, where it is now docked.The evacuation of sailors and staff on board infected with COVID-19 began on Sunday evening. According to French news channel BFMTV, 'at least 40 cases', of COVID-19 had been reported on board by Sunday as it made its way to port. CNN says the figure is now more likely to be 50. Around 50 sailors are being taken to the former site of the Saint-Anne army training hospital, which moved to new buildings in 2008. The premises have been fitted out to receive patients from the Charles de Gaulle. Local authorities said it was a painstaking operation to remove the personnel to ensure there was no risk of any further infection, and three sailors had already been evacuated to hospital Toulon as a 'precaution' before the ship docked. All the personnel will be tested and they will then be put into isolation for two weeks, with no physical contact allowed with their families, said the spokeswoman for the regional authorities, Christine Ribbe. 'Our aim is to protect all our sailors and also their families with an unprecedented deployment,' she added.Only once the isolation period is over will the sailors be allowed home. From Tuesday, the ship itself has been subject of a major disinfection operation. The vessel is equipped with a medical platform on board complete with a resuscitation unit, and everything was being done to keep those who were thought to be infected away from their comrades. Beyond sailors and commandos, the Charles de Gaulle has an air wing of 600 pilots and support crew.It carries aircraft including Rafale M fighters and AS532 Cougar helicopters and was launched in 1994. It was the only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier built outside of the United States Navy. The U.S. Navy has also struggled to contain the virus once it comes aboard a ship. About 12 percent of the ship's 4,800 strong crew aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier with a crew that has largely been moved ashore in Guam, are infected with the virus. On Monday, the Roosevelt reported its first death, a sailor who had tested positive for the coronavirus on March 30. A second sailor from the aircraft carrier has since been taken into intensive care. Nearly 600 crew members (around 12 percent) from the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive to COVID-19 since initial cases were confirmed on March 24. The ship was thrust into the international spotlight when its captain, Brett Crozier, was relieved of his command by the Navy on April 2 after he sounded the alarm over the outbreak on board his ship. Crozier had sent a letter to Navy bosses pleading to let his sailors off the carrier, fearing that up to 50 of his crew could die from the virus. Despite firing Crozier for breaking the chain of command, the Navy conceded to his demands for mass testing and a wide scale evacuation of the ship. Medical ships docked in both Los Angeles and New York City have seen staff infected with the coronavirus. The U.S. Navy removed 116 medical staff members from its USNS Mercy docked in Los Angeles today, while four staff on the USNS Comfort hospital ship that is docked in New York City have tested positive. According to the latest figures from the Johns Hopkins University, France ranks fourth in the world for the highest number of COVID-19 cases, with 131,362 infected. So far, France has suffered 15,750 deaths from the disease. The US ranks first in both cases and deaths, with 604,270 and 25,289 respectively."
"Kim Kardashian's long-time hairstylist has been praised for sharing a foolproof tutorial for trimming guys hair on social media during lockdown. Chris Appleton, 36, a British hair pro who now lives in Los Angeles where he has styled the likes of Kim and Jennifer Lopez, posted a tutorial for clipping men's locks on his Instagramfeed where it quickly went viral. Within minutes of sharing the video with his one million followers, Chris was inundated with comments from fans who thanked him for his clear and simple instructions. Posting the clip, he wrote the caption: 'You all asked for it and here it is how to cut men’s hair during quarantine.' The video begins with Chris explaining the equipment needed to cut men's hair at home, which includes scissors, clippers, sectioning clips and a comb. Explaining his technique, Chris said: 'First of all what you want to do is section the hair, so that you know what's going to be short and what's going to be longer. 'So sides and back, take a section from the temple area and follow it through to the bone in the back, that's a great guideline for creating your fade.' He warned that it's important before you start cutting to opt for a head size on your clippers that is one size longer than the one you're used to. The celebrity hairstylist explained that following the guidance will allow for corrections if needed. Chris recommended to always start cutting from the front, in front of the ear and working your way up to the top. 'Make sure when you get to the top, you get a bit of a flicking action with your wrist. Flick the hair out,' he advised. To create a fade, he changed the head on his clippers from a four to a three, and continued the flicking method, while only going halfway up. Switching to his scissors, he said: 'Now to blend the top bit, take the sectioning clips out. I wet it with a bit of water. You want to imagine a half circle shape on the top of the head, which effectively is the shape of the head. 'Take a section from the side and blend in from the shortest area and follow that all around the sides. You're going to do that all around the sides and back.' The hairdresser who also styled Dua Lipa's hair for the Grammys, explained that pointing scissors as you cut achieves a softer look. He finished up the look by moisturizing the hair with Color Wow One Minute Transformation Cream ($24). 'My top tip is to always go a little bit longer than you want, you can always go back in after and sharpen it up of you like it shorter. Make sure you have a mirror at the back if you're doing it yourself,' he added. Asking his followers to tag him in their attempts at following the tutorial, Chris received an overwhelming response from those praising his advice. One person wrote: 'Thank you so much for this video. I cut my son's hair with this as a guide and it worked well! Next time I think I can go a little shorter but I appreciate this so so much!' Another said: 'Yes! Will be doing this on my husband and son! Thank you for sharing' A third added: 'This was great! I thought the fade was at the top to blend! You should have people post the result! I'm doing my teenage boys and boyfriend right now'"
"Coronavirus cases in the Veterans Affairs health system may be double the number officially reported at some medical care sites, according to internal hospital memos. On Tuesday the number of infected veterans treated at VA facilities surged to4,261 patients across 118 department sites, officials said. It's a major jump from the 30 cases reported just a month ago on March 14. However, the number of actual infected patients could actually be twice as high, according to documents obtained by the Military Times that reveal inconsistencies in case reporting. A discrepancy was found at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center in Ohio where the VA reported 37 inpatient and outpatient cases. However, an internal hospital memo issued on Monday seen by the Times shows 66 already-confirmed cases of the illness among patients. The hospital has not commented on the gap in reporting. Veterans Affairs is yet to reply to DailyMail.com's request for comment. That reports comes on the heels of another internal memo that was exposed by the Wall Street Journal last week and revealed major problems in the availability of personal protective equipment at VA sites, despite the organization’s insistence that staff supplies were adequate. As of Tuesday stats, 257 patients and at least nine VA staffers have died from coronavirus-related complications. Among VA patients, the death rate from COVID-19 is about six percent – well above the rate for the country as a whole. The latest national data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show about a four percent death rate among Americans from the virus. However, the VA population tested and treated for COVID-19 is much older than the American population as a whole and health experts say that the elderly are more vulnerable to the killer virus. So far only one person in VA care COVID-19 fatality has been under the age of 40. Nearly three-quarters of VA patient deaths from the virus have been 70 or older. Today the epicenter of the virus is in New York, where the Big Apple boasts about 19 percent of all confirmed virus cases in the country. On Tuesday the VA’s medical center in Brooklyn became the deadliest site within the system with 32 fatalities, surpassing the department’s hospital in New Orleans that had reported 31 fatalities. The VA’s center in the Bronx has seen 27 deaths. The New Orleans site has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the department’s health system reporting 429 cases. While the VA is scrambling to treat the mounting number of cases, officials have activated a ‘fourth mission’ to make more than 1,500 beds available for non-veteran patients. On Tuesday the department reported caring for 80 outside patients in New York, 24 in New Jersey, 27 in Michigan and four in New Mexico. Five of those patients in New York and one in New Jersey died from the illness. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie shared a statement saying: 'Helping Veterans is our first mission, but in many locations across the country we’re helping states and local communities. VA is in this fight not only for the millions of veterans we serve each day; we’re in the fight for the people of the United States.' A veterans home in Massachusetts is now under investigation by federal authorities after at least 18 residents died from the virus after it emerged that infected employees were still showing up to work. The Department of Justice announced on Friday that it would be investigating the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke to determine if the facility was providing adequate care for its residents amid the coronavirus pandemic. It comes after two employees who tested positive for coronavirus were still showing up for work out of fear of losing their jobs. The federal investigation is separate from a state investigation that is currently underway. Across the nation there are 152 VA Medical Centers and 1,400 community-based outpatient clinics in the US."
"With the UK in lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, homeowners are going the extra mile to keep their houses clean and tidy in the hope that good hygiene will halt the spread of the deadly illness. But according to the experts atChristy England, who supply towels to Wimbledon and the royal family, people often put off washing their bedding and towels - with anestimated one in 20 people changing their sheets just once a month. Speaking to FEMAIL, Helena Mead at Christy England has revealed why we all need to be washing these items much more often - including putting pillows in the machine every three weeks to help stop the spread of illness. WASH BED SHEETS, DUVET COVERS AND PILLOWCASES EVERY WEEK 'Bedding should be washed once a week. Be sure to follow the washing instructions on the care label, as different fabrics need to be washed at different temperatures. According to the NHS, bacteria can be spread on clothes, towels and sheet in three ways. If someone is ill, they may have germs or bacteria on items such as towels and linens they use. To stop the spread of infectious diseases passed through linens, these should be washed at 60C with a bleach-based product. Items are likely to cause illness if you have someone in your home who has an infectious illness. 'Many people get this wrong and leave it far too long. Not washing your bedding for a number of weeks can result in a build-up of sweat and bacteria which over time can be harmful. 'Before you wash, make sure not to overload the machine to avoid damaging the bedding in any way. 'After washing, remove from the machine as soon as possible and for best results, tumble dry straight away.' WASH PILLOWS EVERY THREE WEEKS 'When we say pillows, we don't just mean the cases, but the actual pillows. 'Pillows should be washed every three weeks because, similar to bedding, they contain a build-up of sweat and dead skin. 'Most good quality ones will be able to endure several washes without going lumpy, but be sure to check the care label. Synthetic and feather pillows can be washed at slightly different temperatures.' Wash towels every two days 'Whilst washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water helps to prevent the spread of unwanted and harmful germs, the final step is drying them with a towel, so it's very important to keep them clean too. 'Towels pick up bacteria from the human body, and combined with the addition of moisture, towels can become a breeding ground for bacteria. 'Using a towel that is used, unwashed and damp can spread bacteria throughout the household. 'Wash towels after two days of use.Regularly washing towels will expel bacteria on the towel. 'Wash towels at 60 degrees so that all the microorganisms are removed. 'After every use, allow towels to completely dry out. Rotate your towels to give wet towels time to dry. 'Don't share your towels with family members.Everybody should have a separate towel to discourage the spread of bacteria between people. 'Avoid hanging towels to dry on the same hook or bar. Spread them out separately so that as much surface area is exposed as possible."
"Scammers are increasingly using the guise of streaming giant Netflix to steal money from people during the coronavirus pandemic, a security company says. US cyber safety company BrandShield has detected a total of 639 new domain names registered containing the word 'Netflix' in them since the beginning of 2020. More than a third of these dodgy webpages were set up in March, when millions of people turned to streaming to alleviate the boredom of social isolation. The fake sites, including netflixgiftcard.site and netflix-payment1.com, attempt to dupe victims into entering their personal information, including payment details. BrandShield says criminals are also trying to compromise account details of both existing and potential Netflix users through phishing emails and social media. The following are just some of the 639 Netflix imitation web domains, considered dangerous by BrandShield: · netflix.fit · www.netflixvietnam.com · netflixgiftcard.site · netflix-payment1.com · netflixfreeaccounts.net - with malware · www.netflix-france.net - with malware · netflixgift.com · netflixhesap.site · netflixcoro.com.ve · netflixfreeaccounts.net - with malware · www.netflix-france.net - with malware · netflixhesap.site · netflix.fit Brandshield’s chief executive said governments must now do more to educate the public about how they can protect themselves and their personal identity online. ‘As the world goes into lockdown, cybercriminals are capitalising on people spending more and more time online. Consumers of streaming websites are increasingly at risk of successful phishing attacks,’ said BrandShield CEO Yoav Keren. ‘We have seen an explosion in domain names featuring “Netflix” as criminals are looking to catch consumers out and extract financial or personal records.' Fake Netflix sites are created by criminals who are looking to steal money from viewers hoping to access Netflix content by entering their billing information. The company has provided a list of some of the potentially dangerous webpages - some of which use the Netflix branding. For example, web pages such as netflixvietnam.com and netflixcoro.com.ve are posing as the Netflix pages for particular countries asking for people’s payment details. The fake Vietnamese Netflix site claims to offer a 4K Netflix account for a 'shocking price' that gives users 'peace of mind'. 'We are proud to be the only reputable unit over 2 years in the field of providing cheap Netflix accounts in Vietnam,' the criminals add. Meanwhile netflixcoro.com.ve, aimed atVenezuelan users, says its payments are taken through the South American e-commerce company Mercado Pago. Others, like netflixhesap.site, boast a 'free Netflix account service' that will be opened 'soon' - below which is a telltale WordPress anomaly. BrandShield said 41 percent of the 639 new websites created in 2020 also have a mail server indicating that phishing emails may also be being sent. Of the 639 new domain names detected by the company, 236 domains – nearly 40 per cent – were registered in March as lockdowns consigned people to their homes. Some of these new domains are still online and are marked as dangerous by web browsers, with warnings that the site may trick visitors into installing software or revealing personal information. And Facebook is hosting links to these dangerous sites, despite the social network reiterating its claim to remove posts that take advantage of the COVID-19 situation. BrandShield said it has found instances of phishing and fraud enabled by Facebook user groups that link to fake Netflix domains, including one Bangladesh-based group that claims to sell user accounts. While some of these Facebook pages do not link to a webpage, they do include contact details. The creators of these pages hope people will get in touch, share key personal information and payment information, and be left waiting for either the Netflix streaming service, or subsidised Netflix account as the fake sellers take their funds. BrandShield’s findings are thanks to its anti counterfeit software, which scans the internet for fake online marketplace listings, including Amazon and eBay. Its system automatically send a takedown notice to the relevant service providers– including domain registrars, internet service providers and social media platforms– and alerts anti-virus platforms to block the websites. 'BrandShield protects some of the biggest corporations in the world and we take down thousands of threats across websites and social media every month,' saidKeren. ‘We are getting companies approaching us all the time asking for our help. ‘This problem is only going to get bigger as people spend more time transacting and interacting online.’ Almost £2 million has been lost to coronavirus-related fraud across England, Wales and Northern Ireland alone, according to the UK's cyber crime reporting centre. Action Fraud said it seen a number of different scams relating to COVID-19, including people and businesses falling victim to online shopping frauds. Phishing involves cyber-criminals attempting to steal personal information such as online passwords, bank details or money from an unsuspecting victim. Very often, the criminal will use an email, phone call or even a fake website pretending to be from a reputable company. The criminals can use personal details to complete profiles on a victim which can be sold on the dark web. Some phishing attempts involve criminals sending out infected files in emails in order to take control of a victim's computer. Any from of social media or electronic communication can form part of a phishing attempt. Action Fraud warn that you should never assume an incoming message is from a genuine company - especially if it asks for a payment or wants you to log on to an online account. Banks and other financial institutions will never email looking for passwords or other sensitive information. An effected spam filter should protect from most of the malicious messages, although the user should never call the number at the bottom of a suspicious email or follow their link. Experts advise that customers should call the organisation directly to see if the attempted communication was genuine. According to Action Fraud: 'Phishing emails encourage you to visit the bogus websites. 'They usually come with an important-sounding excuse for you to act on the email, such as telling you your bank details have been compromised, or claim they’re from a business or agency and you’re entitled to a refund, rebate, reward or discount. 'The email tells you to follow a link to enter crucial information such as login details, personal information, bank account details or anything else that can be used to defraud you. 'Alternatively, the phishing email may try to encourage you to download an attachment. The email claims it’s something useful, such as a coupon to be used for a discount, a form to fill in to claim a tax rebate, or a piece of software to add security to your phone or computer. 'In reality, it’s a virus that infects your phone or computer with malware, which is designed to steal any personal or banking details you’ve saved or hold your device to ransom to get you to pay a fee.'

"A doctor has told of the moment he broke hospital rules to allow a daughter to say a tearful goodbye to her dying mother. Dr. Ronald Simon, who isChief of Trauma at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, is one of thousands of medical professionals who is working on the front lines helping treat patients with coronavirus. In a moving Facebook post, Dr. Simon said that allowing members of a family to say their final farewells has helped him 'heal and go back to work day after day in this crisis.' Although the female patient ended up passing away shortly after he bent the strict rules he believes his actions ultimately 'left the family with a little more sense of peace.' Dr. Simon wrote that part of the reason he allowed a one-off visit is because he is personally afraid of dying alone. 'For me, dying alone is more frightening than dying itself. Why? Who knows!' he wrote. 'A middle aged woman is dying from a very severe COVID pneumonia. All of our efforts are keeping her alive but barely and we knew that she could pass at any time,' Dr. Simon explained in his posting. 'Although our unit has a no visitation policy to protect the patients and staff from others, and others from the patients, we decided that we needed to make an exception here. 'She was a mother with two older children so we reached out to them to come see their mother while she was still alive. When the daughter arrived she told me she had two young children so we wrapped her up in masks, gowns, gloves and caps and let her see her mom. Dr. Simon explained to the woman's daughter that she would be allowed to hold her mother's hand and advised her to speak to her, as she would certainly be able to hear her despite being heavily sedated. It seemed to make all the difference in the world. 'She turned to me with a look of astonishment and relief and said ""She can hear me? I need to tell her I love her.""' 'With those words she walked into the room and made peace with her dying mother. 'A few minutes later her son walked in and did the same. Minutes later, she had passed,' Dr. Simon said. 'I was sad about her passing but she was just one of many,' he recalls. 'What made my day was that with her passing, her children would never lament that they never had the chance to tell their mom that they loved her before she passed,' the trauma doctor noted. Since the post was written, a number of people have shared their thanks for the doctor's heartfelt words. 'This is beautiful, humane and yet... heartbreaking. A very sad joy,' wrote fellow hospital workerDekeya Slaughter. 'You pulled the heart strings. Beautiful Ron that her kids had those few moments for the last time. May she Rest In Peace,' said another hospital workerSally Vagnini Jacko. 'You may have lost one life that day, but you saved two by allowing the children to see their mother. You work miracles, Ron. Thanks for all you are doing,' added another. In a separate posting online, the trauma surgeon reveals how while his training has prepared him to 'do battle with life and death on a large scale,' the entire coronavirus outbreak is 'different'. 'I give my hospital administration tremendous credit for taking action faster than most, but we are still reacting to a new situation every day,' he writes. The doctor explained how he has seven face masks - one for every day of the week which allows each one a full week to decontaminate before it is used again. 'Thiswould have been unheard of just a month ago,' he remarks. 'Today, I am fortunate to have this.' 'Doing battle with a hidden enemy that is potentially anywhere and everywhere is tough. Being in NYC, the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. is a challenge, but one shared with so many dedicated people that it is a privilege to fight side by side with them. 'Everyday choices get harder and we are just at the start. Pray for all of those ill and those caring for them,' Dr. Simon urges."
"J.C. Penney Co Inc on Wednesday said it is skipping a $12 million interest payment as the retail giant faces bankruptcy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Plano, Texas-based company said it would not be making the April 15 payment in a filing Wednesday. They have a 30 day grace period before an 'event of default'. Nationwide lockdowns mean the chain was forced to temporarily shut its 850 department stores, upending its turnaround plans, according to people familiar with the matter. J.C. Penney is said to be contemplating a bankruptcy filing as one way to rework its unsustainable finances and save money on looming debt payments, which include significant annual interest expenses. Concerns about prolonged store closures and customers remaining sparse even when outlets eventually reopen have also factored in to J.C. Penney's deliberations, some of the sources said. The coronavirus outbreak has hammered traditional brick-and-mortar department store operators and other retailers that had to close their doors to customers to curb its spread. J.C. Penney also has a $105 million bond repayment due in June. The retailer must also contend with about $300 million in annual interest expenses, and faces more than $2 billion of debt maturing in 2023, according to regulatory filings. Best Buy said on Wednesday it would furlough about 51,000 employees. The company saidits sales dropped about 5 per cent in the first two months of the current quarter, as the electronics retailer kept its stores shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. It said that starting next week, some corporate employees would also participate in voluntary reduced work weeks and furloughs, while its top management and board would take a pay cut. Best Buy, however, would retain about 82 per cent of its full-time store and field employees. J.C. Penney has not made any final decisions on how to address its strained finances, the sources said. The retailer is also considering asking creditors for breathing room through transactions that would rework debt outside of bankruptcy court proceedings, the sources added. There is also a possibility that J.C. Penney will be able to secure rescue financing, one of the sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. The 118-year old company has had to furlough some of its roughly 85,000 employees and slash spending.Its online business is still running, though it does not contribute to the lion's share of the company's sales. Harley-Davidson Inc said on Wednesday it had temporarily laid off most of its global production employees and implemented salary cuts in a bid to lower costs as the coronavirus pandemic has hurt its business. The announcement comes weeks after the motorcycle maker withdrew its earnings forecast for this year, saying pandemic-induced disruptions could dent its ability to supply and sell motorcycles. Best Buy said sales grew about 25 per cent during an 8-day period ended March 20, a day before the company announced its decision to switch to a curbside delivery model, as people shopped for work-from-home equipment, gaming-related products as well as products needed to freeze food. The company added that domestic online sales surged over 250 per cent from a year earlier, with half the sales coming from customers who picked-up their products from stores. However, store closures and decreased footfall have dented demand, and sales dropped 30 per cent from March 21 through April 11, Best Buy said. 'The situation remains very fluid and there is still a great deal of uncertainty, particularly as it relates to depth and duration of store closures and consumer confidence over time,' Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said. The company has already withdrawn all financial forecasts for fiscal 2021 and drawn down the full amount of its $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. Best Buy had nearly 125,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, at the end of fiscal 2020, according to an annual filing. Shares of the company, which will report its results for the first quarter ending May 2, late next month, were down about 6% in early trading on Wednesday. The coronavirus outbreak has hammered traditional brick-and-mortar department store operators and other retailers that had to close their doors to customers to curb its spread. They were already struggling as consumers shifted to online shopping, before the coronavirus infected more than half a million Americans, resulting in more than 23,000 deaths. Macy's Inc, the largest U.S. department store operator by sales, has tapped advisers at investment bank Lazard Ltd and law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP to explore options including new financing. Last week, peer Nordstrom said it borrowed $600 million against its real estate. Neiman Marcus Group,another department store operator, is advancing bankruptcy preparations. Retail industry furloughs passed the one million mark in the United States last week as T.J. Maxx, Dick's Sporting Goods and Abercrombie & Fitch became the latest industry giants to announce cuts. Dick's Sporting Goods said an unspecified 'significant' number of employees would be furloughed from April 12. And off-price retailer TJX Companies Inc, the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and HomeSense, said on Tuesday it would furlough most of the employees at its stores and distribution centers. TJX, which had about 286,000 employees as of February 1 according to its latest annual filing, will pay its staff until the week ending April 11. J.C. Penney 'has been engaged in discussions with its lenders since mid-2019 to evaluate options to strengthen its balance sheet and maximize its financial flexibility, a process that has become even more important as our stores have also closed due to the pandemic,' a company spokeswoman said in a statement. The pandemic 'has created unprecedented challenges,' she said, adding the company remains focused on its turnaround plan and looks forward to reopening stores. J.C. Penney attempted unsuccessfully to persuade creditors earlier this year to restructure and push out due dates on portions of its nearly $4 billion of long-term debt without the need for bankruptcy proceedings. It hoped to buy time for Chief Executive Jill Soltau's turnaround plan to bear fruit, as it faced fierce competition from e-commerce firms as well as discount retailers such as the TJX Cos Inc's Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains. J.C. Penney had recently made some strides in its turnaround attempt, meeting or exceeding guidance on financial objectives for 2019 and improving sales at some stores. The company has been reducing inventory and refocusing on its core higher-margin business of selling mid-priced apparel to middle-class families. The novel coronavirus outbreak threw a wrench in its plans. J.C. Penney in March drew down $1.25 billion from its revolving credit line. On March 31, it said it was also 'evaluating other financial options,' without providing further details. But in another sign of J.C. Penney's financial woes, the company has added corporate turnaround experts at AlixPartners LLP who specialize in urgently addressing stressed finances to its roster of advisers, one of the sources said. Bloomberg News reported on that appointment on Monday. J.C. Penney's revenue could plunge more than 25% this year, according to Fitch Ratings Inc. The credit ratings firm predicts that could cause J.C. Penney's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to turn 'materially negative' to the tune of $400 million in 2020. J.C. Penney bonds due in 2023 were trading at roughly 43 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, indicating investor concerns about the company's ability to repay its debts. U.S. retail sales plummeted a record 8.7 per cent in March as the viral outbreak forced an almost complete lockdown of commerce nationwide. The unprecedented decline in sales far outpaced the previous record decline of 3.9 per cent that took place during the depths of the Great Recession in November 2008. Figures show the hit to the economy is worse that had been projected; experts predicted an 8 per cent decline in monthly sales. Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, told CNBC: 'The economy is clearly in ruins here.' Auto sales dropped 25.6 per cent while clothing store sales collapsed, sliding 50.5%, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Restaurants and bars reported a nearly 27% fall in revenue. The U.S. has by far been the hardest-hit country, with more than 26,000 deaths and over 600,000 confirmed COVD-19 infections. As a result U.S. consumer confidence has plunged and the vast majority of Americans are hunkered down at home under shelter-in-place orders. Consumer spending drives two-thirds of the U.S. economy, and the record drop in retail sales is a symptom of the sharp recession that most economists believe the U.S. has already entered. Economists at JPMorgan Chase now forecast the U.S. economy will shrink by a record-shattering 40 per cent in the April-June quarter. 'With clear signs of panic buying of necessities and the fact that lock downs were introduced only around the middle of the month means that far worse is to come in April and the second quarter more generally,' said Michael Pearce, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm. World's richest man gets even richer from coronavirus! Jeff Bezos sees his own fortune grow by $24billion as Amazon's value hits $1.1 TRILLION on back of lock-down online shopping - and workers who say their lives are at risk Jeff Bezos has seen hisfortune grow by $24billion this year amid surging online orders duringcoronaviruslockdowns. The Amazon's founder saw his net worth spike by $6.4billion on Tuesday and Amazon is now worth $1.1 trillion after its shares hit a record high. But while Bezos' wealth rocketed by 20% over the last four months to $138billion, his employees at many warehouses have warned their lives are at risk by continuing to go to work. The Seattle-based firm has been facing increasing anger over safety and working conditions of warehouse, delivery and retail gig workers in the United States after cases of COVID-19 were reported in at least 74 of its facilities. On the same day as Amazon shares surged in value, Gerard Tuzara, a worker at the firm's warehouse in Southern California died from the virus. The company's founder was last week named the world's richest person for the third year running - despite his divorce last year which cost him a quarter of his stake in the tech giant. Bezos, 56 – who founded the e-commerce company out of his basement in Seattle, Washington, in 1994 – gave $36billion worth of stocks to ex, Mackenzie. She also saw her net worth rise by $2.3 billion yesterday, to a total of $44.8 billion, as Mackenzie still owns around 4% of Amazon shares. As of Tuesday afternoon Amazon's stock was up more than four per cent closing at $2,283.32 per share. That topped the online retail giant's previous high of $2,170.22 per share on February 19. With stocks rocketing, Bezos, who currently owns an 11.2% stake in Amazon, saw his fortune grow by $6.4billion to $138billion yesterday, according to a Forbes estimate. The economic damage from the outbreak has been widespread and severe after only a few weeks into the shutdown. The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the world economy will suffer its worst year since the Great Depression. But for Amazon a surge in demand of around 20% for online orders from those under lockdown that has seen it's stock price rise. Amazon stock surged 5.6% on Tuesday, hitting a new record high,up over 20% so far this year, at a time when the benchmark index - the S&P 500 - is down over 12%. One analyst forecast a sales increase for Amazon of 23% for the first three months of 2020. The online retailer is the first major company to rebound from the coronavirus market sell-off, which started in late February as the coronavirus crisis worsened.    "
"A new study from one of the nation's top hospitals is giving health experts an inside look into what the novel coronavirus does to the lungs. Dr Sanjay Mukhopadhyay, director of pulmonary pathology at the Cleveland Clinic, reported the results of two autopsies, including one of a 77-year-old Oklahoma man who died from the virus. He found that the inside of the lung air sacs were slathered in a substance that resembled slime or thick paint, which makes it difficult to breathe. Mukhopadhyay says he hopes that by releasing more results from autopsies, doctors can identify problems the virus causes and treat them with available drugs. Mukhopadhyay told WOIO that this is the first time anywhere in the world that autopsy reports of COVID-19 patients have been published in the English language. He was asked to review the results by the Oklahoma Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. 'In the last three days I've had perhaps two dozen requests from all over the world, all over the world literally from Europe, from Japan, from all over the United States,' Mukhopadhyay said. 'What we're looking for in these autopsies is some glimmer of hope of some kind of finding which could be reversible.' For the study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology, looked at two autopsies of men who died in Oklahoma in March 2020. The first was a 77-year-old obese man with a history of hypertension. He had symptoms for six days - including fever and chills - but never sought treatment nor was tested for the virus until after he died. 'Then suddenly became weak and short of breath and then by the time he got to the hospital he had already had a cardiac arrest so he never made it to an ICU or ventilator treatment,' Mukhodpadhyay told WOIO. 'So he died before that so we got to see what happens in the lungs of a patient who dies from COVID without being on a ventilator or getting any treatment.' The autopsy revealed that the many had a thick coating that resembled slime or paint inside his lungs. It had caused airway inflammation and damage to the alveoli - the tiny, elastic air sacs in the lungs - which made it difficult for him to breathe. 'It's actually proof that the virus itself is causing the damage,' as opposed to a ventilator Mukhopadhyay told Cleveland.com. The autopsy of the 42-year-old obese man revealed that, although he was diagnosed with coronavirus, he didn't die from it. Instead, he had a pre-existing condition that put him at greater risk of contracting bacterial pneumonia, which he did die from. The 42-year-old did not have the thick paint-like coating inside his lungs. The autopsy of the 42-year-old man was perhaps more interesting. While he had coronavirus, he didn't die from it. He didn't have the paint-like coating inside of his lung air sacs. Instead he died of a bacterial pneumonia. 'Therefore, this patient likely died with COVID-19, not from COVID-19,' the study states. 'These cases illustrate the challenges that pathologists and the medical community at large will face in determining the cause of death in (deceased people) who test positive,' for the virus. Mukhodpadhyay said he hopes that more autopsies will help lead to treatment for patients currently infected. 'Well they are looking into insights into what is potentially going on in the lungs that is reversible,' he told WOIO. 'Is there anything there that can be treated? Is there anything there that you can use a drug to target it?' Worldwide, more than two million people have been infected and more than xx,000 people have died. In the US, there are more than 615,000 people confirmed cases of the virus and more than 26,000 deaths."
"A New York City hospital has created a new tradition to help lift spirits amid the COVID-19 crisis. Staff at NewYork-Presbyterian Queens have started playing Journey's rousing 1981 smash Don't Stop Believin' each time a coronavirus patient is discharged from the facility and sent home. Heartwarming video filmed April 10 shows two recovered patients partaking in the ritual as nurses push them through the lobby before they are transported back to their homes. 'Every patient discharge gives hope to NewYork-Presbyterian Queens staff. They are encouraged to see their patients recovering and going home,' Jaclyn Mucaria, the hospital's president told Storyful in a statement. In the video, a male patient is seen raising his hands victoriously in the air as he celebrates his release from hospital while the hit song plays in the background. A female patient who has also been discharged is seen clapping along excitedly. Although a mask covers much of her face, it is clear she is smiling widely. However, most excited about the patients' releases are the hospital workers, who dance and cheer through the hallways. Like many medical facilities in The Big Apple, NewYork-Presbyterian Queens has been struggling in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 100,000 New York City residents have tested positive to the virus. One nurse from New-York Presbyterian Queens told The New Scientist last month described scenes inside the hospital as something from 'a war zone, but without the blood'. 'It's inconceivable. Everything we know about medicine is out the window,' said the nurse who has been practicing for more than 40 years. On Wednesday, New York state added another 752 fatalities, bringing the official death toll above 11,500. 'We are not out of the woods yet,' Governor Andrew Cuomo stated at his press conference Wednesday. 'Coronavirus is still a monumental public health crisis and we are losing New Yorkers every day to this virus. Each New Yorker lost to COVID is a heartbreaking loss.'"
"US stocks fell on Wednesday as dismal economic and first-quarter earnings reports compounded concerns over the extent of damage from the coronavirus outbreak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 445.41 points, or 1.86%, to 23,504.35, the S&P 500 lost 62.7 points, or 2.20%, to 2,783.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 122.56 points, or 1.44%, to 8,393.18. Shares of Bank of America and Citigroup Inc dropped as they joined JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co in reporting a slump in first-quarter profits. Also, Goldman Sachs Group Inc's quarterly profit nearly halved, as it set aside more money to cover for corporate loans expected to go bust in the coming months. In further evidence of economic damage from the coronavirus, U.S. retail sales plunged 8.7% in March, manufacturing output dropped by the most in over 74 years and a survey showed manufacturing activity in New York state plunged in April to its lowest in the series' history. Disappointing bank earnings are weighing on sentiment as well as prospects for the rest of the corporate reporting period, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago. In the coming weeks, 'it's going to be more important to look at companies... from a debt perspective,' he said, noting: 'I'm not sure the recovery is going to be as strong as everybody is saying.'  It comes as UnitedHealth Group Inc, the biggest US health insurer, reported a fall in quarterly profit. J.C. Penney Co Inc slumped 14.7% as sources said the retailer was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection after the virus outbreak upended its turnaround plans. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co kicked off the earnings season on Tuesday by reporting a slump in quarterly profits and setting aside billions of dollars to cover potential loan defaults. With dire forecasts of the biggest economic slump this year since the Great Depression, analysts expect earnings for S&P 500 firms to slide 12.3% in the first quarter and 23.6% in the second, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv. The benchmark S&P 500 index has climbed about 30% from its March trough, lifted by a raft of US monetary and fiscal stimulus and on early signs that coronavirus cases were peaking in some hotspots, but is still down about 16% from its record high. The index jumped 3% on Tuesday on hopes the Trump administration could move to ease lockdowns as the outbreak showed signs of ebbing. However, hotspot New York later sharply raised its official virus death toll to more than 10,000. Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp slipped about 3% as oil prices tumbled, pressured by reports suggesting persistent oversupply and collapsing global demand. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc fell between 0.9% and 2% before the release of their financial results later in the day. J.C. Penney Co Inc is exploring filing for bankruptcy protection after the coronavirus pandemic forced the U.S. retailer to temporarily shut its 850 department stores, upending its turnaround plans, according to people familiar with the matter. The Plano, Texas-based company has access to enough cash to survive in the months ahead, even as revenue dries up because of the store closures, the sources said.

"Thedirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says he expects a second wave of coronavirus cases will hit the US next year. Dr Robert Redfield addressed the possibility of a resurgence of infections after this year's crisis is over on Good Morning America on Wednesday, as the number of cases nationwide topped 633,300 with more than 27,000 deaths. 'The CDC is science-based, data-driven, so we don't know for certain until we see it.But it is critical that we plan that this virusis likely to follow aseasonality pattern similar toflu, and we're going to haveanother battle with it up frontand aggressively next winter.' 'This is why it's so important wetake the time now to reallyimprove our testing capacity,expand our public healthcapacity to do early caserecognition, contact tracing,isolation - I call it block andtackle, block and tackle.' Redfield admitted that officials were under prepared for the current pandemic as he assured viewers that his agency is doing everything they can to prevent that from happening again.  'The outbreak this year got aheadof that so went into fullmitigation and lost the abilityto use critical public healthtools,' he said. 'We are working hard to augmentthem now so that as we get intothe next season we'll be able tostay in high containment modewhile we complement that withsome continued mitigationstrategies.' The CDC director went on to praise Americans for their 'exceptional' adherence to the drastic social distancing measures in place right now. 'I think not onlyany of us can under-appreciatewhat the American public did,' he said. 'When we did our original modelslooking at this outbreak, we werelooking at up to2.2 million people that mighthave died by the fall.When you see, even though 26,000 is still anenormous loss of human life, itreally is a tribute to themitigation that the American public did. 'When we do behavior modificationand ask people to do things, as adoctor, which I am, theyfrequently don't do it forthemselves. But, boy, am Iimpressed what the Americanpublic did to protect thevulnerable and other people. 'It's really a testament to thesacrifice that they've taken andleadership to give that examplein a number of these states.' Redfield said the CDC is now working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the White House coronavirus task force in laying plans to gradually lift lockdowns. It came hours after a strategy devised by FEMA and the CDC leaked in the media on Tuesday night, revealing that the government is lobbying to reopen by May 1. The strategy, first obtained by the Washington Post, offers guidance to state and local governments as for how best to ease mitigation efforts and phase out restrictions, such as strict stay-at-home orders, to ensure safe re-openings. When GMA host George Stephanopoulos asked Redfield how many states will be able to reopen by May 1, he avoided giving an exact number. 'It's allgoing to be data driven and as Ithink it was mentioned, it'sreally going to be astate-by-state decision,' he said. 'There are a number of countieswithin this country that havenot experienced really anyconfirmed coronavirus despitetesting.There are a number of states,19, 20 states that really havehad limited impact from it, so Ithink we will see some statesthat the governors feelthey're ready. 'We're poisedto assist them with thatre-opening. I think you'llsee the plan in terms of howthat will happen will befinalized by the White Housetask force in the days ahead.' Redfield spoke in more detail about what needs to happen in another interview with CBS This Morning. 'It's going to be really important to get a few things in place: more obviously testing for early diagnostics, expand the public health capacity for early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing,' he said. 'This is going to be fundamental to maintain and contain cases as they occur. And then make sure we have the health capacity to deal with this, as we work to regain the confidence of the American public that it's safe to go back to work.' When asked about a study released this week which indicated that Americans may need to social distance until 2022, Redfield sidestepped specifics. 'I think the mitigation steps that we've done are going to be an important component of it,' he said. 'I think it's really, really a moment to take a bow for the American public that really embraced the social distancing recommendations that we put forward.' Redfield notably appeared to distance himself from Trump at one point in the GMA interview after host George Stephanopoulos mentioned the president's official announcement that the US will freeze funding to the World Health Organization. 'Did WHO fail here? Is it wise to suspend funding in the middle of this crisis?' Stephanopouos asked. 'CDC and WHO has had a long history of working together in multiple outbreaks throughout the world, as we continue to do in this one,' Redfield replied. 'And so, we've had a very productive public health relationship. We continue to have that.' 'So they didn't fail?' Stephanopoulos pressed. 'I'd like to do the postmortem on this outbreak once we get through it together,' Redfield said. A strategy devised by government officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was leaked on Tuesday, revealing that the government is lobbying to re-open parts of the US by May 1, beginning with schools and churches. The strategy, first obtained by the Washington Post, offers guidance to state and local governments as for how best to ease mitigation efforts and phase out restrictions, such as strict stay-at-home orders, to ensure safe re-openings. The coalition task force has been working on the plan for the past week. Its contents have since been discussed by the White House's coronavirus task force as the Trump administration presses forward with its plans to get Americans out of their homes and back to work as soon as possible. Appearing to be an early draft, the document contains scant instructions for gradual re-openings of institutions such as churches, schools, child-care facilities, summer camps, national parks and restaurants. According to the Post, two anonymous administration officials said the president wants the plan finalized in the coming days in a bid to re-open 'low-risk' states by May 1. At a White House press briefing on Tuesday, the president hinted that plans to reopen the country were near to completion. Trump also explained he'shoping to speak with all 50 state governors 'shortly' in an effort to implement 'a very powerful reopening plan', with a specific date and time in mind for each state. 'We think we're going to be able to get them open very quickly,' Trump said of the some 20 states he credited as having managed to avoid the types of devastating outbreaks seen in the likes of New York and New Jersey. 'We will hold the governors accountable. But again, we’re going to be working with them to make sure it works very well,' Trump continued. Sources inside the White House told the Post the president has been so insistent on reopening the country quickly that they fear only a narrow window exists in which to provide information that will help to change his mind - and in turn help to stem the rising number of infections and deaths. Another source said the leaked document, dated April 10, contains only two parts of the coalition's eight-stage plan. The full plan contains three phases. The first of which is preparing the nation to reopen with a national communication campaign and community readiness campaign by May 1; phase two would run through May 15 and involve increasing the manufacturing of test kits and protective equipment, while boosting emergency funding; and finally phase three would see staged re-openings beginning on a case-by-case basis. According to FEMA and the CDC, the primary focus will be to 'reopen community settings where children are cared for, including K-12 schools, day cares, and locally attended summer camps, to allow the workforce to return to work. Other community settings will follow with careful monitoring for increased transmission that exceeds the public health and health care systems.' During the phased re-openings, the document emphasizes that it's critical to continue to strictly follow the hand-washing recommendations and the wearing of face-coverings in public, which are currently being instructed now. The experts, however, warn a '30-day shelter in place [order] followed by 180-day lifting of all mitigation results in large rebound curve — some level of mitigation will be needed until vaccines or broad community immunity is achieved for recovering communities,' the Post reported. Reopening communities in this way, the document theorizes, will 'entail a significant risk of resurgence of the virus.' As a result, any such plans for a reopening must meet four key criteria before being approved. Firstly, the incidence of infection must be considered 'genuinely low'; there must also be an effective monitoring system in place capable of detecting an increase in infection incidence; the public health system must be reacting robustly to all cases of COVID-19; and hospitals must have sufficient staffing and beds to deal with any sudden surge in cases. The plan also outlines conditions in which it would be reasonable to lift some mitigation measures, the phased steps required to do so, and indicators to help monitor the impact of transmission on public health and health system capacities. In communities with low mitigation measures in place, where the virus never significantly spread to, experts recommend those places can reopen soon. Moderate mitigation measures are recommend for former hot-spots undergoing 'controlled recovery', and significant mitigation is recommended in current or emerging hot spots. The document also shows recommendations for the CDC to form a COVID-19 Response Corps to assist state and local health departments with key public health functions, including hiring a squad of contact tracers who would be tasked with locating people who may have had contact with someone infected by the virus. The recommendation appears to be a response to calls from health experts who have, in the last week, urged state and federal officials to expand their capacity of contact tracers as local health departments currently lack the necessary resources to effectively identify people who've come into contact with infected patients. It also states that answers for 'app-based case and contact investigations will be necessary for augmenting the actions of public health workers and for greatly increasing the important role of slowing COVID-19 transmission in the community.' Google and Apple have already confirmed they're in the process of developing an app to track people's movements so that when they're confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, public health workers could go back and trace anyone the patient has come into contact with. However, the ethics of such software has raised a number of eyebrows with many considering the concept to pose a substantial encroachment on civil liberties. "
"A New York pediatrician said she thought a staggering 80 per cent of children in the city are infected with the coronavirus as she explained that most kids have not been tested as they are not the priority in hospitals. Dr Dyan Hes, a pediatrician with New York City's Gramercy Pediatrics, offered the statistic when explaining that there were 'zero tests for children' to see whether they had COVID-19. 'We have zero tests for children. We have zero swabs,' she explained to CBS. 'I've had patients whose parents have COVID, child has a 102.5 fever. At the beginning when we were doing this, we were sending them to the ER. They got turned away. They were not tested because we do not have enough tests and the kids are doing well.' A CDC report published last week that focused on the disease's impact on children found that while'most cases reported among children to date have not been severe, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 infection in children and monitor for progression of illness, particularly among infants and children with underlying conditions.' Roughly 1.7 per cent of the coronavirus cases reported as of April 2 were patients under the age of 18. Some 147 children have been hospitalized, including 59 that are under the age of 1. Three children have died from the virus. But Dr Hes believes that the real numbers of children with the disease are much worse, blaming the lack of testing for why more accurate figures aren't available. 'I don't mean to be rude, but the numbers are totally wrong,' Hes said. 'I think that probably 80% of the children have coronavirus. We are not testing children. I'm in New York City. I can't get my patients tested. And we have to assume, if they are sick, they have coronavirus. 'Most of them, probably 80 to 90% of them, are asymptomatic. So, these numbers are so skewed. I think that the mortality rate is way, way less than 0.5% for children who have it because it is so prevalent. You have to remember thousands of kids die from flu a year. This is much, much less virulent in children.' The pediatrician said families should just assume their child probably has the coronavirus if they start showing symptoms. 'You won't know,' she said. 'If your child does have a low-grade fever right now and a cold, you have to assume that it's COVID because you're really not going to get tested in New York City. In other states, maybe you'll get tested. But in most places, we're saving the tests for the sickest.' Dr Hes said that the large number of children with asymptomatic symptoms could spell disaster for others who could still get infected. 'The problem with children is that they are so asymptomatic that they are spreading it. And our biggest mistake was that we didn't close the public schools when we should have,' said Hes. 'So the children were the vectors to the teachers, who might be elderly or immunocompromised. They might have diabetes or cancer, but they still had to come to work every day. They still had to take the subway every day.' Doctors are offering video consultations for those who need to have their children's health monitored. 'The really only reason your child should be going to a physician at this point, aside from a vaccine visit, is if they're short of breath,' she said. 'If you're social distanced and your child has a fever, then somehow that child probably brought it into the house by playing with a neighbor or maybe when you went grocery shopping, you brought it in. But you just have to keep that child at home for 14 days. Socially distance. When they go back out, if they're above age 2, they should be wearing masks.' Children under two struggle tolerating the masks, the doctor added. Some 21 teachers in the city have died as a result of the coronavirus, according to the New York City of Education on Monday. The report from the CDC does state that children with mild or no symptoms did contribute to the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, health department officials shared that they were headed towards not having enough swabs to conduct tests for the virus. As the swab supply continues to decline, there is a real possibility hospitals will completely run out,' the April 11 health alert said. 'At this time, providers are reminded to only test hospitalized patients in order to preserve resources that are needed to diagnose and appropriately manage patients with more severe illness.' The warning came amid repeated pleas from New York City and state officials for the federal government to provide widespread testing in order to move to a containment phase in the coronavirus outbreak. Since early February, when the number of coronavirus cases confirmed in the United States was just a handful, city officials have been begging the government for test kits. At least three letters were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention beginning in early February asking the federal agency to expedite the delivery of coronavirus test kits to the city. The pediatrician's statements come as New York City announced 3,778 additional 'probable' deaths attributed to coronavirus, which were never confirmed because no test was administered. The probable deaths, announced on Tuesday, occurred between March 11 and April 13, and when combined with confirmed deaths take the city's coronavirus death toll higher than 10,000. The probable cases would put New York City's per capita death rate much higher than Italy's, and increase the national U.S. death toll by roughly 17 percent. Due to a shortage of test kits, particularly in the early days of the outbreak, not everyone hospitalized in critical condition or found dead at home was able to be tested for the virus. Postmortem tests were often not conducted in order to conserve test resources. City officials said that the newly announced deaths were ruled probable based on the known symptoms and health histories of the patients who died. Roughly 60 percent of the probable deaths occurred in hospitals, versus 90 percent for confirmed cases, according to city data. Eighteen percent of the probable deaths occurred in nursing homes, and 22 percent occurred in private residences, officials said."
"U.S. retail sales plummeted a record 8.7 per cent in March as the coronavirus outbreak forced an almost complete lockdown of commerce nationwide. The unprecedented decline in sales far outpaced the previous record decline of 3.9 per cent that took place during the depths of the Great Recession in November 2008. Figures show the hit to the economy is worse that had been projected; experts predicted an 8 per cent decline in monthly sales. Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, told CNBC: 'The economy is clearly in ruins here.' Auto sales dropped 25.6 per cent while clothing store sales collapsed, sliding 50.5%, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Restaurants and bars reported a nearly 27% fall in revenue. The U.S. has by far been the hardest-hit country by the pandemic, with more than 26,000 deaths and over 600,000 confirmed COVD-19 infections. Rupkey added: 'Nobody is buying cars, down 25.6 per cent, nobody is buying furniture, down 26.8 per cent, and eating and drinking places were down 26.5 per cent.' As a result U.S. consumer confidence has plunged and the vast majority of Americans are hunkered down at home under shelter-in-place orders. Consumer spending drives two-thirds of the U.S. economy, and the record drop in retail sales is a symptom of the sharp recession that most economists believe the U.S. has already entered. Economists at JPMorgan Chase now forecast the U.S. economy will shrink by a record-shattering 40 per cent in the April-June quarter. 'With clear signs of panic buying of necessities and the fact that lock downs were introduced only around the middle of the month means that far worse is to come in April and the second quarter more generally,' said Michael Pearce, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm. Signifying the titanic shift in consumer behavior, grocery store sales jumped by nearly 26 per cent as Americans stocked up on food and consumer goods to ride out the pandemic. And a category that mostly includes online shopping rose 3.1 per cent. Spending may be falling at an even faster pace than the retail sales figures suggest. Stocks are opening broadly lower on Wall Street as more signs emerge of how much damage the coronavirus shutdowns are causing the economy. Major U.S. indexes fell more than 2% in the first few minutes of trading Wednesday, and bond prices rose as investors sought safety. Retail sales plunged an unprecedented 8.7% last month as the outbreak forced a near total stop to commerce across the nation. A measure of manufacturing in New York State plunged to its lowest level on record, and a global energy agency predicted that worldwide demand for oil will fall this year by the most in history. Wednesday's report doesn't include spending on services such as hotel stays, airline tickets, or movie theaters, all of them suffering some of the most severe financial duress during the outbreak. The toll of the devastation is being unearthed as the U.S. releases more data from different sectors of the economy. On Wednesday, the U.S. reported that industrial production, which includes manufacturing, mines and utilities, posted the biggest drop in March since 1946. The pullback in spending is intensifying the problems facing brick and mortar retailers which were already struggling with online competition. With a nationwide shutdown of malls and most stores, the pandemic is putting many clothing retailers in peril, while increasing the dominance of big box stores that have remained open during the pandemic because they sell essentials like food and household goods. More than 250,000 stores, including Macy's, Nordstrom and Nike, which sell non-essential merchandise have been shuttered since mid-March. That's 60 per cent of overall U.S. retail square footage, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalRetail Research. A record 6.6 million new claims for unemployment benefits were filed the week before last, according to the latest Labor Department figures released last Thursday. That means the coronavirus outbreak has thrown at least 16.8 million Americans out of work in just three weeks as it continues to tear through the country, bringing the economy to a near standstill. Major retailers including J.C. Penney, Macy's and Nordstrom have furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers, while Walmart and Amazon are on hiring sprees to try to meet the surging demand of shoppers buying online or for curbside drop-off or delivery. Department stores and mall-based chains have cut executive pay, suspended cash dividends and stock buybacks or repurchases to preserve cash. They're also drawing down their credit lines to make sure they have a bigger pile of cash on hand. Nordstrom warned last week that it doesn't know when it will be able to reopen its physical stores and that prolonged closures could cause it to become financially distressed. Ralph Lauren and Gap Inc. have announced that, for now, they've stopped ordering products for the fall. Other retailers will likely follow. Discretionary spending by shoppers is expected to collapse 40%-50% in the first-half 2020, according to Fitch Ratings. And department stores lead a group of consumer companies that have seen their odds of default spike over the past month, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. J.C. Penney is facing bankruptcy after pandemic forced the temporary closure of its 850 department stores and the 118-year old company furloughed 85,000 employees J.C. Penney Co Inc is exploring filing for bankruptcy protection after the coronavirus pandemic forced the U.S. retailer to temporarily shut its 850 department stores, upending its turnaround plans, according to people familiar with the matter. The Plano, Texas-based company has access to enough cash to survive in the months ahead, even as revenue dries up because of the store closures, the sources said. Still, the company is contemplating a bankruptcy filing as one way to rework its unsustainable finances and save money on looming debt payments, which include significant annual interest expenses, the sources added. Concerns about prolonged store closures and customers remaining sparse even when outlets eventually reopen have also factored in to J.C. Penney's deliberations, some of the sources said. J.C. Penney has not made any final decisions on how to address its strained finances, the sources said. The retailer is also considering asking creditors for breathing room through transactions that would rework debt outside of bankruptcy court proceedings, the sources added. There is also a possibility that J.C. Penney will be able to secure rescue financing, one of the sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. The 118-year old company, which has had to furlough some of its roughly 85,000 employees and slash spending, is now considering skipping looming debt payments and filing for bankruptcy to address its debt, the sources said. Its online business is still running, though it does not contribute to the lion's share of the company's sales."
"The CEOs and executives of America's top airlines could still stand to make millions this year under the rules of a Treasury Department deal to inject $25 billion in federal aid to meet their payroll obligations in the coronavirus crisis. The terms of the Treasury bailout deal cap executive pay using a formula based on 2019 compensation, which hasn't yet been released in the companies' regulatory filings. But in 2018, the CEOs of American, Delta, United and Southwest Airlines received annual compensation ranging from $8 million to $15 million. The 'Big Four' CEOs all receive a substantial part of their compensation in company stock, which has plunged in the crisis, making the exact compensation they stand to take home this year under the salary cap rules difficult to precisely quantify. As well, those CEOs who have a cash salary have already accepted salary reductions ranging from 10 percent to 100 percent during the crisis. Airlines who accept the Treasury bailout will have executive compensation caps in place tied to 2019 salary levels through March 2022. Officers and employees whose total compensation (including stock) exceeded $3 million in 2019 may not receive total annual compensation that exceeds $3 million plus 50 percent of the excess over $3 million of total compensation received in 2019. Prior to the bailouts, most of the CEOs of the 'Big Four' US airlines had already agreed to cash salary cuts. American CEO Doug Parker does not get paid a base salary or a cash bonus. 'He made a change to his compensation in 2015 to be paid only in stock. So he’s already at zero and has been for several years,' a spokesperson told DailyMail.com. Parker's stock-based compensation totaled$11,999,517 in 2018. American's stock is down more than 85 percent from its peaks in 2018, so Parker's compensation may be significantly impacted. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said last month that he will forgo 100 percent of his salary for the next six months. 'Our Board of Directors elected to forego their compensation over the next six months as well,' he said in a statement last month. Bastian made $14,982,448 in total compensation in 2018, of which $3,168,757 was in the form of salary and bonus, and the rest was in the form of stock compensation. United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby both said that they will forsake 100 percent of their salaries through the end of June. Kirby had been scheduled to take over as CEO of the airline in May. In 2018, Munoz earned a total compensation of over $10 million and Kirby took home roughly $5.5 million. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly announced last month that he will take a 10 percent pay cut during the crisis. In 2018, Kelly’s base salary was $750,000, but his total compensation neared $8 million. The funds for the airline bailout were allocated under the $2.3 trillion CARES Act stimulus bill signed into law last month. According to the statute controlling the bailout, companies receiving funds cannot lay off employees before September 30 or change collective bargaining agreements and must agree to restrictions on buybacks and dividends, whichare banned through September 2021. Also accepting federal aid were: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, and SkyWest Airlines. The deal includes 10 of the top 12 U.S. carriers. The other two, Spirit Airlines and Republic Airlines, said on Tuesday that they were still in discussions with the Treasury. The assistance will include a mix of cash and loans, with the government getting warrants that can be converted into small ownership stakes in the leading airlines. Major carriers will receive 70 percent of the funds for payroll in cash assistance that will not need to be paid back, while smaller carriers receiving $100 million or less will not need to repay any funds. The airlines did not want to give up equity, but Treasury demanded compensation for taxpayers. The airlines have little leverage - their business has collapsed as the coronavirus pandemic reduces air travel to a trickle and they face mass layoffs without the federal aid. The statute gave Treasury the authority to demand compensation for the grants, but did not require it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the department would work with the airlines to finalize deals 'and disburse funds as quickly as possible. Airline workers hailed the deal as a way to preserve their jobs in the crisis. 'We are closer than ever to almost a million airline workers knowing they will receive their paycheck and keep their healthcare and other benefits, at least through September,' said Association of Flight Attendants President Sara Nelson, who is widely credited for the idea of aid specifically for payroll. 'At the same time, we were able to rein in the worst corporate practices by tying this aid to restrictions on stock buybacks, executive compensation and dividends.'"
"With gyms closed and Britons limited to one session of outdoor exercise per day, a growing number have taken up running and cycling as well as home workouts to keep fit during lockdown. In addition to improving our mood, regular physical activity can provide a timely boost to the body's ability to fight viruses and infections. But experts are warning against overdoing it on the exercise front, as you could leave yourself open to injury and hamper your immune system. Dr Matthew Jackson, a lecturer in Sport and Health Science at Liverpool Hope University, arguedanyone taking up sports like running for the first time, or after a long break, need to be mindful about painful injuries. While encouraging people to stay active and healthy during the social shut-down, he also advised enthusiasts not to go hell for leather with their training as that stress potentially leaves the body open to invasive pathogens. Dr Jackson told FEMAIL:'We don't want to tell people not to exercise during this crisis - it's really important that you do. 'But if you're finding yourself doing more of it because you've got more time on your hands, you just need to be mindful about not doing too much. 'For the majority of people, doing regular exercise is actually a really good way to improve immune function, providing a defence against viruses. 'But you do need to be careful that you don't go into that over-training category where you might compromise your immunity. 'The science behind exercise and immunity involves the complex interaction of a number of different cells, including immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, which can help identify an infection-causing pathogen like a virus, alongside other more specific cells known as white blood cells or lymphocytes, which engulf and destroy the foreign cells in the body. 'Your expression of these cells - produced in the bone marrow - is improved through exercise. It's essentially like a muscle - the more you work it the more efficient it becomes. 'But prolonged bouts of vigorous aerobic activity could actually lead to immunosuppression, as these cells are redistributed and diverted to key tissues and organs active during exercise, rather than elsewhere in the body.' Government advice stipulates that members of the public can leave their homes for 'one form of exercise a day'. It puts no time limit on the span of your exercise, but states that those undertaking outdoor exercise must 'minimise the time you are out of your home'. Guidance suggests a 'run, walk, or cycle', and whatever you do, you shouldremain at least 2 metres apart from anyone who is not a member of your household. It also urges people to stay local and use open spaces near to your home where possible. Dr Jackson pointed to recent research which showed levels of different immunoglobulins and lymphocytes were found to be lower after vigorous exercise. 'In the current climate of coronavirus, you shouldn't really be going over an hour's exercise per session,' he said. 'Stay active to maintain your fitness but don't risk going beyond that and compromising your immune system - at the same time as potentially coming into contact with more people who may be carrying the disease.' When it comes to injury prevention,Dr Jackson said rest days are crucial. He added: 'lower intensity, moderate exercise is usually okay. But if you're doing something more vigorous, you're more exposed to injury. 'You might think, ""Right, I've got an hour each day, I need to make the most of it with a hard workout."" But there's a danger of over-training. 'If you're just starting out running for example, stick to three times a week, with sessions of 30-45 minutes at first, and go from there. 'Low-level activity like walking can be done more frequently, five or six days a week - but again be sure to factor in at least one full rest day.' Watch your 'load' Dr Jackson said: 'There's a well established general rule that you shouldn't increase your training load by more than 10 per cent each week. That could be in terms of miles run, or the number of minutes spent doing something. And by going above that 10 per cent, you increase the likelihood of becoming injured. 'If it's a new routine you're getting into, start with two or three sessions per week and make sure you stick with the 10 percent rule.' Frequency, intensity, time and type Always bear in mind the interplay between frequency, intensity, time spent and type of exercise. Dr Jackson explained: 'You want all of these elements in a training programme to try and get fitter and develop. But you only want to work on those elements one at a time. 'If you're starting a new regime, you might want to do an extra session one week, but don't make that session harder as well. You might want to have the same amount of sessions per week, but on one of those sessions you could go a little bit harder. And remember that 80-90 per cent of the exercise you're doing should be moderate, as opposed to high intensity.' Beware tendonitis The most common sorts of injuries you might pick up are muscular stains, joint issues and tendonitis - which is a painful inflammation of a tendon usually triggered by overuse. Dr Jackson revealed: 'People pick up tendonitis quite regularly when they've increased their training. And it can be pretty debilitating, sometimes even needing surgery to remove the damaged tissue. 'Look out for pain around the knee, hips, elbows, ankles and shoulder in particular. So if you're thinking about going running every day, you need to be sensible.' Foot pain Dr Jackson warned: 'If you're throwing yourself into a new running regime, beware issues with the achilles tendon and also plantar fasciitis, a searing pain on the underside of the foot and which often rears its head when people start doing more walking or running, when they start exercising on hard surfaces for the first time, or if they wear shoes without proper support.' Target the glutes Moderating your exercise regime could also ward off Iliotibial band syndrome, or ITBS.Dr Jackson says: 'This is really common among runners starting a new routine. There's a long tendon that stretches from the outside of the hip all the way down to the outside of the knee. 'If you strain it, pain will be concentrated around the outside edge of the knee, where the tendon is rubbing over the bone. That's usually down to a weakness in the glute muscles. So it's prevalent among people who might typically spend a lot of time sitting down. 'The glute muscles - the hip extensor and hip abductor - can experience atrophy. And if they're weaker, you're more likely to pick up ITBS. People simply aren't aware of the atrophy until they start to exercise properly.' Remember that DIY is exercise, too Dr Jackson said: 'If you've thrown yourself into a DIY project, you need to be careful about repetitive strain injuries, too! You might spend the whole weekend decorating, and then find yourself with tennis elbow a few days later. 'It's usually down to an imbalance of the flexor and extensor muscles, which work in pairs. If you do a particularly repetitive activity where you're just using the one set of muscles, you're pulling the tendon over those bones and it's rubbing all the time. That's what causes the inflammation - and it can be really painful.' Moderate home workouts 'You're not immune to injury if you're doing home workouts in front of a screen either - as squats performed with inadequate technique can cause lower back or knee pain,' Dr Jackson pointed out. 'Again, it's about moderation, if you are new to exercise, I'd be wary of doing a home workout every day. By including sufficient rest, you are more likely to make consistent progress and achieve your long term goals.' "
"An Alaska-based photographer has spent the past few years taking incredible aerial photos of some of the largest airports in the United States. The images were captured by photographer, Toby Harriman, who developed a love for aerial photography and cinematography after taking his first doors-off helicopter flight in 2012. The images show breathtaking views of airports like San Francisco International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago Midway International Airport, San Diego International Airport, Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport and the Los Angeles International Airport. Harriman said he has also photographed smaller airports like the Talkeetna Airport in Talkeetna, Alaska. Scroll down for video Some of the images show dozens of planes of all sizes from major airlines like United and Delta Air Lines parked at terminal gates. Photos show planes taxiing to the runways, while other images showed planes taking off. Harriman even captured some planes landing, including a FedEx cargo plane that was seen preparing to put its wheels down at the San Diego International Airport. Harriman's images aren't just limited to the runways and terminals, He also captured aerial views of the unique designs of parking garages and roadways surrounding some of America's busiest airports. In an interview with the New Atlas, Harriman revealed that the first airport that he ever took aerial photos of was the San Francisco International Airport. Harriman told the site that while his favorite airport to photograph was Chicago O'Hare, it was also the hardest. 'The most logistical has been Chicago O’Hare,' Harriman said.'I was working for client shooting properties on literally every side of the airport. So we were crossing back and forth. We were even put on hold over 15 minutes at one point,' he explained. Harriman also explained why Chicago O'Hare was his favorite airport to photograph. 'Just listening to the air traffic controllers here was fascinating. You realize how difficult their jobs are, not that I was making it any easier being there for a photo flight,' he told the New Atlas. Harriman hasn't decided which airport he will photograph next, but he did say that his goal is to finish off the major airports in the US before moving on to capturing aerial images of airports in other countries. 'At this point, I haven’t shot enough to really narrow down my next locations,' he explained."
"A couple married for 78 years died within hours of each other Friday after the husband, a World War Two veteran, remained with his wife despite her coronavirus diagnosis.  David, 102, and Muriel Cohen, 97, from Massachusetts shared a room in their nursing home and the family chose to keep them together even as Muriel tested positive for the fatal virus. After 78 years of marriage, the couple had never been separated, apart from David's service during World War Two when he helped liberate the Ohrdruf concentration camp in Germany in 1945. 'I said, ""My parents cannot be separated, and my dad and mother have to stay together,"" so that was exactly what we did,' the couple's daughter, Fran Grosnick, told WCVB, adding that both her parents were already very ill. The Longmeadow couple, who were residents at the Jewish Nursing Home, were both tested for coronavirus but only Muriel tested positive. 'They were both very ill with other conditions, and aware only that they were together. This was comforting and they did not suffer,' Grosnick explained of the decision to leave them sharing a room instead of isolating. David and Muriel, then Muriel Brown, first met in the summer of 1942 when she was in nursing school in Brooklyn. 'Their love story began in the summer of 1942 and continued until last Friday,' Grosnick said. 'She left nursing school to marry him and they were always together, except for when he was in the service.' David passed away at 6.50pm Friday, aged 102, and Muriel died less than two hours later at 8.30pm. 'My parents are together and my parents are at peace,' Grosnick said. 'I was very fortunate to have my parents for a very long time. I was fortunate and I was blessed, and I'm going to remember that.' Photos taken by David at Ohrdruf concentration camp are displayed in the permanent collection at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. He served as a radio operator with the U.S. Army. 'When my father got there, it was the most horrific sight that (he said) he had ever seen in his entire life,' Grosnick said. 'He spent the rest of his life speaking about his liberating experiences and teaching area school children about the Holocaust and to ""never hate"",' Cohen’s family wrote his obituary. 'During David’s time in the military, during the liberation, [he] took an abundance of photographs, some of which can be seen in the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.' According to WCVB, the family plans to hold a celebration of the couple's lives when the pandemic is over. In Colorado, the family of 21-year-old baseball player Cody Lyster are in mourning after he died from coronavirus on April 8. His doctors initially believed he would pull through, as he was a young and active man with no underlying health conditions, but within days he was hospitalized and placed on a ventilator. He is the youngest person in Colorado to die from the virus. While coronavirus is known to be especially perilous for the elderly, there are still young and healthy adults among the more than 27,600 fatalities across the United States. 'They felt he was strong, his heart looked good, [because] he was a college athlete playing baseball,' his father Kevin Lyster, 49, told PEOPLE. 'He was living right and doing everything that he was supposed to be doing, and they believed he would make it through.' His father, a police officer, had already tested positive for the virus in mid-March before Cody returned home for spring break from Colorado Mesa University. The family ensured they did not have contact with Kevin but Cody still managed to contract the virus. 'I was down in either the basement or the family room,' Kevin said. 'We made sure that if somebody was going to a common room, like the kitchen, that we'd let each other know and we did everything that we were supposed to do to stay away from each other.' Cody initially began to show signs of a fever but his symptoms worsened on March 30 when the 21-year-old began coughing badly and his family found him confused with a body temperature of 104 degrees. 'At that point, we called the fire department and they came,' Kevin said. 'That was the last time I saw our son alive in person.' Cody died days later after his heart and kidneys failed. His family never got to say their goodbyes but they hope that his story can warn others of the danger of the outbreak and how it can affect anybody. 'Our son is proof positive that it can take the life of a young person,' his mother Lea Ann said. 'I do think that there are a lot of younger people out there thinking, ""I'm invincible, this can't affect me."" Unfortunately, our family can tell you that that's not the case. 'He died alone' she added. 'I mean, there was no family. There was medical staff with him, but he died without one single family member there. It's the worst feeling ever.' 'My son has a very high platform from heaven right now,' his father Kevin continued. 'He has the message to get out to everybody across the world that you need to take this seriously and you need to stay at home.' Cody is one of 329 coronavirus deaths in Colorado, where there are 7,950 confirmed cases. As of Wednesday evening, there were 27,613 coronavirus deaths in the United States and more than 633,000 cases. A New Yorker lost both his mother and brother to coronavirus in just 24 hours as the outbreak in the epicenter continues to cause significant loss of life. Lloyd Torres, 49, described the heartbreak of losing two immediate family members in one day in Queens, the hardest hit borough in the city, and called on others to stay safe and to let his family be a warning. 'Grief is so different in this time of crisis, because we're all isolated,' he told NBC. 'You can't have a funeral. You can't have a memorial service. So you're dependent on these phone calls, text messages and social media contact as a proxy for that.' Torres' brother Louis, 47, wasdirector of food services at a nursing home in the Queens' neighborhood of Woodside, and had continued to work even as the city was shutdown. He first fell ill on March 30 when he called his brother to tell him about his difficulties in getting home. Louis lived with the brothers' mother Lolita, 73, who had immigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines in the 1980s. 'He wasn't eating,' Torres said. 'He said he couldn't keep anything down. He was nauseous. Same thing with my mom.' Louis took the next day off work but by April 1 was in so much pain 911 was called and he was brought toNew York–Presbyterian Queens Hospital. Their mother Lolita was brought to a different hospital later that day. Torres described the heartbreak of not being able to see his mother or brother, his only sibling, as they battled against the virus. The first challenge was tracking down their mother, as the family did not initially know which hospital she had been taken to. It took an entire day to find her as Torres, who works in information technology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and his wife, Chantal, who works in administration at White Plains Hospital, used their contacts within the healthcare system to track her down. 'A lot of other families don't have those resources, don't have those contacts, so I can only imagine what they're going through in terms of getting updated information on their loved ones,' Torres said. He was able to use his contacts to get in touch with his brother and mother's caregivers who would supply them with updates on their condition. Both Louis and Lolita tested positive for coronavirus and were diagnosed with pneumonia. Louis was brought intensive care while Lolita was using a mask with pressurized air as she was having trouble breathing. On the evening of April 6, Torres was able to speak with his mother and they prayed the rosary together. He received the news that she had passed away the following morning. 'I think that gave her some peace and settled her down,' he said. 'They said her heart had stopped,' His 47-year-old brother died hours later after his heart also stopped. He had experienced deteriorating kidney functions and his lungs were not working properly. 'Dr. Ford had been calling me every day with updates on my brother,' Torres said. 'I could feel the weight of the world crashing down on me. 'I could tell that he and his team tried their best and did all they can do.' He has now warned that people must remain vigilant and understand how serious the outbreak is. 'The thing that we hope that others understand is how serious this crisis is,' he added. 'We all need to be very vigilant. No one could tell how my brother or mother contracted this. I don't think we'll ever find out. 'If we can help other families understand the importance of not taking anything for granted and staying safe and protecting themselves and their communities, that will give their lives a sense of meaning.' An activist who worked with transgender sex workers and illegal immigrants in New York died of coronavirus after a lack on Spanish interpreter at the hospital left her unaware that she needed to quarantine. Lorena Borjas, 59, died on March 30 after years of working as a mentor and champion for the community of Latina transgender sex workers in Queens, working to win them a legal immigration status and arranging access to HIV care, lawyers and bail funding. She became a citizen herself last year after receiving a pardon from Gov. Andrew Cuomo following several arrests in the '90s link to her own time as a sex worker. Yet despite all her efforts for other immigrants, it was not easier for Borjas to navigate access to her own care when she first went to hospital with a fever and a cough in March and no Spanish translator was available to help her. According to Buzzfeed News, Borjas ran away from her home in Veracruz, Mexico, when she was 17 and immigrated to the United States in 1981 after spending several years living on the streets in Mexico City. She was awarded a green card in 1986 when President Ronald Reagan granted amnesty to undocumented immigrants. 'Lorena is and will always be that trans mother, who, although she lived through hard times and life was unfair to her, she always wanted better for us,' Liaam Winslet, told BuzzFeed. Winslet is a transgender woman from Ecuador who sought asylum in the US in 2012 with Borjas’ help and was one of the last people to speak to her. 'Everybody would have Lorena’s number on speed dial,' said Cecilia Gentili. They first met when Borjas organized HIV testing in a bar. 'Early in the morning, she’d go to the courts to wait for the girls to see the judge — it makes such a difference when a judge looks at a sex worker and sees if they have someone behind her.' One of the main driving factors behind Borjas’ passion for helping transgender sex workers came from her own experience and knowledge of the importance of a helping hand. 'She was very interested in breaking the cycle that is arrest, jail time, immigration detention, deportation procedures,' Gentili said. 'She knew if she was able to pay the bail, the girls wouldn’t go to jail… When you fall in the first step, you just keep going down.' Borjas was arrested several times after she received her green card status as she struggled with a drug addiction and more dangerous sex work. She lost the ability to renew her green card because of the arrests, despite getting her life back on track in the late '90s, until Cuomo’s pardon came. Most of her activism was achieved without the support of any organization but she succeeded in getting bail for dozens of sex workers and improving their access to healthcare. 'She was the driving force behind, I would [estimate], hundreds of LGBTQ people getting immigration status over the last decade,' said Chase Strangio, the deputy director for transgender justice at the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project. Strangi and Boirjas had teamed up in 2011 to start a bail fund for sex workers that directly bailed out more than 50 people. Borjas first fell ill on March 14, calling Gentili to cancel a meeting. Not wanting to go to the doctor, Gentili called an ambulance for her and she was taken to the Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Without a Spanish interpreter available, however, Borjos was not able to handle her own care and while the hospital ran a coronavirus test, she would never receive the results. She left the hospital again two days later, on March 16, after showing signs of improvement but Borjas did not understand that she needed to quarantine. Her health took a turn for the worst on March 25 and she was brought back to hospital and placed on a ventilator. She died March 30. Winslet said that Borjas 'didn’t want to stay in the hospital, precisely because of her previous experiences’. 'There are many institutions that exclude us, that limit us, that silence us, and many times we are cast to the side… But we fight.' Eight retiree neighbors got infected with coronavirus and three died in a matter of weeks while they kept playing their beloved daily game of poker where they would swap stories about their grandchildren. The spread of the virus among the longtime friends, aged in their 70s to 90s, can be traced back to the last game they played on March 12 in Florida - several days before the state issued a lockdown order and banned gatherings. The eight elderly retirees first met in South Florida casinos and formed a bond over their love of the game, before they started running their own game out ofan Aventura condominium. The group, who would travel on cruises together and saw each other as 'family', met to play poker five times a week for the last 10 years where they would play over pots of less than $100. But the March 12 game would turn out to be fatal. The group met as normal that day, hugging and passing round cards, cash and chips while they shared stories of their grandchildren. Just weeks after the game, three of their group have been killed and the other five infected with the killer virus. Marcy Friedman, 94, a former New York secretary who moved to Florida to retire, helped organize the decades-long weekly games held at 7 p.m. Sunday to Thursday. She developed breathing difficulties on March 15 and was hospitalized the following day. Ten days later she tested positive for coronavirus and died on March 28 atAventura Hospital. She had underlying heart, lung and kidney conditions. Two of the other friendsBeverly Glass, 84, and Fred Sands, 86, a loving couple of 20 years who lived in Hollywood, also started showing symptoms of the virus within a week of the game. They were admitted into Memorial Regional Hospital and tested positive for coronavirus. Sands died on March 27 and Glass died on March 31. They were able to spend their last days together holding hands across their hospital beds. Glass' daughter Lori Helitzer told the Sentinel they were 'not a sit-at-home couple' but were 'movers and shakers' that regularly went to casinos around Florida. "
"Bruce Willis insiders are insisting that'everything is great' between the action star and wife Emma Heming while he hunkers down with ex Demi Moore and his adult daughters during the coronavirus pandemic. 'Demi and Emma are close, and all three get on great as a big blended family. There are no issues at all. Emma needed to stay in L.A. with the young kids,' a source toldPeople. Still, there was no explanation as to why the 65-year-old actor wasn't at home with his wife of 11 years and their two young children. Willis is currently in isolation withex-wife Demi Moore, 57, and their daughters Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah, 26, while Emma is taking care of their girlsMabel, eight, and Evelyn, five. Someone close to Moore said that the former couple often spend time together, explaining: 'Demi and Bruce have been best friends for years. They are very close.' Demi was present for Heming and Willis' vow renewal ceremony in March of last year. They returned the favor later that year, supporting Moore at the launch of her memoir Inside Out. Demi and kids have been documenting the big blended family's life inside on social media. In the most recent post the quarantine group - which also includes two of the daughters boyfriends and Demi's longtime assistant - were all seen reading asDemi captioned the shot: 'Family book club... ⁣How to Rule the World from Your Couch — quarantine edition.' The group all held a copy of Laura Day's self-help book How To Rule The World From Your Couch - which uses step by step exercises to achieve goals such as career moves and building new or better relationships. Meanwhile over on Emma's Instagram account, she took to Instagram stories to talk about her skincare line, telling fans she was holding back to back Zoom meetings in a bid to launch the bran in the U.S. There was no mention of Bruce, with whom she has daughters Mabel, eight, and Evelyn, five. With spring break over, the 41-year-old former model is presumably balancing her own work with home schooling her girls. Emma confirmed she was not with her husband of 11 years and his ex last week, when she commented on a photo of them together. She wrote 'Love and miss you guys' on a snap of the famous exes in matching pajamas, posted last Wednesday. While it is unclear whythe family is not all isolating together,Heminghasn't stopped gushing over her stepdaughters' latest pictures on Instagram. 'Not many can pull that color off! Looking good squad,' she commented on one of Tallulah's posts. For her part Tallulah explained to a fan that she and her family had chosen to quarantine together - and had been in isolation for a month. 'We made the choice to quarantine together and have been together for 27 days taking every precaution,' she wrote, about seven days ago. MailOnline has contacted Bruce, Emma and Demi's representatives for further comment. Willis, Moore and their adult children have been documenting their quarantine activities, which have included doing a 'family photo project' and posing in matching outfits. In the two decades since Bruce and Demi's 13-year marriage ended in 2000, they have worked hard to build a happy friendship. Following their break-up, both Bruce and Demi remarried. Bruce was present Demi wed now ex-husband Ashton Kutcher in 2005, while last year Demi was on-hand at Willis' vow renewal ceremony to wife Emma. The group regularly celebrate milestones as one big happy family, and Bruce and Emma even supported Demi at the launch of her memoir, Inside Out, last year."
"A gardening enthusiast has shared how lockdowners with limited resources can grow their own crop of tomatoes - with just half a tomato enough to get a summer crop going. Twitter user Wilf James, from Scotland, has spent his time at home offering tips on how amateur gardeners with small spaces can become budding permaculturists with just a few seeds, a little soil and some sunshine. Permaculture is about working with the resources you have - eg your surroundings and the elements - to 'live lightly' and produce your own source of food. Scroll down for video Although James has offered up an extensive series of tips on growing everything from chives to herbs and fruit, his tomato-growing tweet promises success with just half a tomato and some loo paper plus soil and sunshine. James detailed how to grow a crop in just 280 characters on Twitter, writing: 'If you have the tomato, take the seeds out, dry them on a piece of paper. 'When dry, place in a 11cm pot, cover with 1cm soil/compost and spray with water. He continues: 'Keep it moist to the touch on a sunny window. You will have tomato plants in between three and five weeks.' He added that a 'good crop' would benefit from liquid fertilizer once a week, saying 'tomatoes love nitrates' but added that feeding them cold tea leaves would have a similar effect. He suggests spending a minimal amount on new plants and asking 'a friendly gardener' for cuttings to get your own permaculture garden going. The green-fingered whizz also shared tips on growing carrots using two stacked car tyres as a makeshift plant pot, saying the root vegetable would take around ten weeks to grow in a deep pot from carrot seeds. Herbs also feature heavily, with rosemary and mint also seen sprouting from James' towers of tyres. And for those nervous about dipping a toe into permaculture; James suggested a pot of chives is a great place to start if you're a beginner, saying: 'Chives are really a good first food plant to grow as they are easy to care for and start up with. 'I would recommend them to anyone. Happy gardening everyone.'"
"Former Beatles frontman Sir Paul McCartney has branded Chinese wet markets 'medieval' in light of the coronavirus pandemic and called for them to be banned. Sir Paul slammed the Chinese government for allowing the food markets to continue, saying, 'they might as well be letting off atomic bombs'. Theanimal rights activist was speaking to American radio personalityHoward Stern, on Sirius XM, this week. The conversation centered around reports the deadly virus may have originated at a wet market in Wuhan, China. Sir Paul, 77, is currently self-isolating at his home in Sussexwith daughter Mary and her family. His wife Nancy Shevell is doing the same in New York. Speaking toStern this week, Sir Paul told the flamboyant radio host,'whoever is responsible for this is at war with the world and itself,' according to a Mirror Onlinereport. 'They might as well be letting off atomic bombs because it's affecting the whole world,' he added. Stern said it was 'mind-boggling' the Chinese government has not shut down the markets. According to the Mirror, Sir Paul said he hoped this will mean 'the Chinese government says, ''OK guys, we have really got to get super hygienic around here''.' Sir Paul also said: 'Let's face it, it is a little bit medieval eating bats.' The majority of the stalls at Wuhan's biggest wet marketBaishazhou have resumed business after the lockdown was lifted from the former epicentre. State media footage shows vendors selling live crayfish at the huge market, which occupies 116 acres. More than 3,600 shops are now back in business at Baishazhou, one of the city's main food wholesale markets. Officials have banned the trading of live wild animals or livestock to prevent the spread of coronavirus. During the conversation with Stern,The Beatles singer declared China doesn't 'need all the people dying', adding: 'And what's it for? All these medieval practices. 'They just need to clean up their act. This may lead to it. If this doesn't, I don't know what will,' according to the Mirror Online. When challenged that banning wet markets would be difficult for China to implement, Sir Paul said: 'I understand that part of it is going to be: people have done it for ever, this is the way we do things. 'They did slavery forever too, but you have to change things at some point,' according to the report. 'It wouldn't be so bad if this is the only thing it seems like you can blame on those wet markets. He added: 'It seems like SARS, avian flu, all sorts of other stuff that has afflicted us… and what's it for? Sir Paul reiterated to Stern: 'For these quite medieval practices. They need to clean up their act.' He also discussed with Stern the idea of celebrities campaigning for wet markets to be closed. Talk then turned to TheBeatles frontman planning an appearance atGlastonbury 2020, nowcancelled due to the pandemic. 'What's disappointing for me is the people who bought tickets, who were looking forward to this and thinking here's something groovy to do in the summer, and suddenly the plug is pulled, and we can't come around and play for them,' he said. 'It's sad for us, too – we were looking forward to that.'"
"A Canadian mother-of-two has gone viral for a photo of her own mother meeting her new grandchild for the first time — from opposite sides of a closed window. Jessica, a psychotherapist from Ontario, recently gave birth to her second daughter. But while she was in the hospital delivering her bundle of joy, her parents were both home sick, having tested positive for COVID-19. Their health has since improved, and on Easter they swung by to meet the newest addition to their family — but to be safe, they stood outside Jessica's sliding glass door and merely peeked at the baby inside. Jessica posted a photo on Instagram of the moment her mother saw the baby girl. Her mother appeared to be overcome with emotion as she smiled down at the infant, and held a hand up to the glass. 'Never imagined the first time my parents would meet my daughter would be through a sliding glass door,' Jessica, who also has a three-year-old daughter, wrote. 'When we had our daughter a few weeks ago both of my parents were sick with COVID-19. They were quarantined at home, and very quickly as things with COVID escalated all of our plans for support for birth and postpartum changed. 'I was feeling nervous for both of them and very nervous for how the first few weeks of postpartum would look. 'Fast forward to today,' she wrote on April 12, 'they are both recovered and feeling healthy and the first few weeks with our baby have gone mostly well.⠀ 'This is not what any of us expected. These times are challenging. I’m not immune to these challenges,' she went on. 'I’ve cried about COVID, worried about my parents and all the others who are sick, lost sleep, grieved over the postpartum l had planned and more.⠀ 'But I’ve also witnessed the kindness of strangers, the amazing care of hospital staff and midwives. I’ve seen healing, had a positive birth experience, felt love and prayers from others, and experienced amazing friends and family helping from a distance. ⠀ 'These times are scary, hard, AND there is still good, light, and joy,' she concluded. 'Did I plan for my parents to meet their grandchild through a sliding door? No. But am I thankful that they could be healthy enough to meet their grandchild through a sliding door? So much yes.' Jessica told Good Morning America that her mom is a 'great grandma' and her 'number one support system' — which naturally made it difficult when she couldn't have her there in the first weeks after the birth. 'They didn't have to be in the hospital which is great, but I worried about my mom because she had asthma,' she said. After they came over on Sunday, Jessica wasn't sure about posting the 'super personal moment,' but she's glad she did. 'I've gotten so many messages from people going through the same thing. It's like this collectively heartbreaking experience but when we can share it together it somehow feels little bit better,' she said. Some other pregnant mothers and new parents chimed in with their own stories. 'Had my Son March 24th and I can relate to your post whole heartily. This has been one of the most challenging time’s in my life as well. It’s comforting to read posts like this and to be reminded that we’re not alone!' wrote one. 'We introduced our parents to our new addition with them looking into our car yesterday. Definitely not the moment i had envisioned,' another said. 'Delivering in 2 weeks and feeling all the feels of my postpartum plans being demolished,' wrote yet another."
"A St Louis-based chiropractor has come under fire for falsely claiming that tonic water is an effective treatment for coronavirus in a Facebook Live video that was viewed by more than 21 million people. In the video, Eric Nepute urged people with flu-like symptoms to drink tonic water because it contains quinine,a medicine that is distantly related to hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug being tested to treat COVID-19. The unfounded remedy spread like wildfire across the internet, drawing the attention of health experts who condemned Nepute's advice as dangerously misleading. Nepute, who runs the Nepute Wellness Clinic in St Louis, posted his video on April 6 with the caption: 'Seriously. How much longer are we going to put up with all the BS..???' 'Quinine acts similar to hydrochloroquine, okay,' he said in the livestream. 'Quinine acts as a transport chain to allow nutrients to get into the cells. 'So I'm telling everybody right now, if you know someone who's got flu-like symptoms - if they've got symptoms of COVID-19, the cold, the flu, whatever - go and get either some quinine and/or some Schweppes tonic water. 'Let me tell you this again: quinine and/or Schweppes tonic water. 'I need every one of you to be sharing this right now, I mean every one. Every person needs to share this because there's a lot of bulls**t going on right now that everybody needs to know about. And I'm going to throw some common sense at you because most people aren't looking at this. Go get some quinine and get some zinc.' A number of medical professionals have since advised the public not to heed Nepute's advice, noting that he is a licensed chiropractor, not a physician. Dr Luis Ostrosky, a professor of infectious diseases at McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said that there is no scientific basis for the treatments Nepute recommended. 'I'm guessing he's going off of quinine as another antimalarial drug,' Ostrosky told Buzzfeed News. 'There's really nothing in the literature about quinine and COVID-19.' WHAT IS IT? Chloroquine is an older version of an anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. It's also an immunosuppressive drug that may treat Lupus. BENEFITS It could have the power to stop coronavirus replicating in cells, and taking hold in the bodySARS-CoV-2 entry into cells in an in-vitro experiment. It blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells in an in-vitro experiment. The malaria drug also believed to have antiviral activity. It can be manufactured cheaply and is sold under the brand name Aralen. In one small French study, some COVID-19 patients showed improvements but there was no way to know if the drug was the reason. Results published in April from another study in France and one in China found no benefit in patients treated with the drug. Dozens more clinical studies are underway around the world. SIDE AFFECTS Heart arrhythmias are a known side effect of chloroquine according to studies of malaria and autoimmune disorder patients. One quarter of the 81 patients given 600mg of chloroquine in a Brazil coronavirus study developed heart arrhythmias and they may have been at greater risk of death. Notably, the patients developing heart arrhythmias were being treated with a higher dose than is being used for most patients in the US. Ostrosky explained that quinine does have slight similarities to hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug President Donald Trump and his supporters have promoted as a miracle treatment for coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine has not been approved as a drug to treat coronavirus and medical experts have not concluded whether the drug is safe or effective for this use. Dr Humberto Choi, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic, noted that the concentration of quinine used in medical circumstances is different from that of soft drinks. As far as taking tonic water and zinc, Choi said while zinc has been studied to see if it could help protect organs against low oxygen supply in cases of severe lung infection or inflammation, it has not been proven to treat the infection itself. 'I don't think people should be fooled to think they are ingesting something that is causing any benefit to them,' he said. Tonic water companies have also been debunking the myth online. 'We would not advise using our tonic water for anything other than making a tasty drink to keep your spirits up during this difficult time,' Fever Tree states on its website. Despite blowback from experts, Nepute has maintained that his recommendation is sound. He spoke to TV station KDKA last week and emphasized the fact that in the video he told viewers: 'This is not medical advice.' 'I've never made one claim at all that any of these nutrients cures or prevents coronavirus,' he told the outlet. He also said that the combination of quinine and zinc is a well-known homeopathic treatment with few, if any, side effects. Facebook's third-party fact-checkers placed a warning on the video indicating that it could contain partly false information before it was taken down completely. Nepute re-uploaded it to YouTube on Tuesday, noting that he expected the site to take the new one down as well. When approached for comment about the Nepute ordeal, a spokesperson for the American Chiropractic Association said that it was urging its members not to spread misinformation amid the outbreak. 'The [ACA] advises its members to follow guidance regarding the prevention of the coronavirus (COVID-19) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other credible sources and to share this information with their patients,' the spokesperson said in a statement to Buzzfeed News. The spokesperson also said the ACA Board of Governors had released a statement to clarify that there is no substantial evidence to support spinal adjustments, the core method that chiropractors use to treat patients, for prevention or treatment of COVID-19."
"Moscow is heading for a similar level of coronavirus infection as New York, a leading Russian virologist has warned. Professor Sergei Netesov says Moscow is facing a major crisis with hospitals already in emergency mode and the health service stretched to the limit. Moscow's usually crowded streets and busy 12million population make it an ideal breeding ground for the epidemic in the same way as New York, the professor said, warning that lockdown measures may have come too late. The alarming prediction comes as Russia builds 18 new coronavirus hospitals from the Baltic to the Pacific, while footage emerged of a child screaming and scared as he was sealed inside a stretcher in Krasnodar. Meanwhile, China urged Moscow to 'get a grip' on infections because most of its new cases have been imported from Russia. Professor Netesov, of Novosibirk State University and the former head of the Vector laboratory which is at the forefront of Russian testing and efforts to find a vaccine, warned the capital would end up with 'the same picture' as New York. 'New York streets are crowded, especially in Manhattan, the same as we have within the Garden Ring in Moscow,' the professor said. 'People communicate actively, they are used to eating out two or three times a day. 'There is a lot of conditions for the disease to spread - that's why we have such an outbreak. 'We will have the same picture [as New York], especially in Moscow.'I very much suspect this although I don't want it.' Moscow currently has 13,002 registered cases, some 61.6 per cent of the Russian total of 21,102. New York state has 203,348 cases and 10,842 deaths. The professor told Reminder Media: 'Russia is at the beginning stage of the epidemic.We practically got 80 per cent of new cases in a matter of one week. 'The death rate is calculated based on those who got infected two, three, or four weeks ago. 'Our numbers are not displaying the real picture yet. 'We are only seeing the top of the iceberg because we don't know how many asymptomatic cases we have.' The professor suggested that up to 80 per cent of infected patients could be asymptomatic carriers who 'don't feel sick and don't even go to the doctor'. 'These carriers walk around in the streets, go to office and very likely spread the infection for one to three weeks,' he said. 'To say that mass testing should not be conducted means to simply ignore asymptomatic carriers,' the professor said. 'Leading US experts, such as [infectious diseases chief] Anthony Fauci immediately said that all contacts of the infected should be checked. 'But in the beginning President Trump and even some medics rejected the need of mass testing. 'And only when one asymptomatic carrier infected almost 200 people in Washington state did they start contemplating it.' Moscow entered lockdown at the end of March, requiring people to show e-passes to prove they are allowed to travel. However, footage showed long queues in a Moscow metro station with many people not wearing masks or practising social distancing. Russia is building a series of new emergency clinics but it is feared they will not be enough to cope with the swelling numbers of patients. Health minister Mikhail Murashko has now ordered all Russian hospitals to be ready to set up coronavirus wards. Pictures show work in progress on army-built hospitals from Kaliningrad in eastern Europe to Kamchatka in on the Pacific coast. Meanwhile, Chinatoday revealed that 79 coronavirus patients who entered from Russia at the Suifenhe frontier post had all recently flown from Moscow to Vladivostok. The Chinese nationals had not been detected by medics as contagious before making the eight and a half hour flight or on arrival in Vladivostok. Russia has only registered 32 infections in the entire Primorsky region - larger than England - of which Vladivostok is the main city. China Daily, owned by the Communist Party, said its country's focus on countering the pandemic was now on border towns like Suifenhe and Manzhouli, where the frontier has been shut. In a pointed remark - aimed at Russia - the newspaper said: 'There needs to be stronger coordination and cooperation with neighbouring countries so they can get a grip on the spread of the virus.' Elsewhere, one of Russia's new clinics has been built in the Arctic to counter an outbreak among migrant workers at a liquid natural gas construction site near Murmansk. Infections have doubled to reach more than 200 at the Belokamenka site, and a total of 268 in the region where three out of four victims are aged under 45. Two huge Ilyushin-76 transport planes flew to Murmansk to set up the military-style clinic. The largest new hospital with initially 500 beds rising to 656 is outside Moscow and has been built in a little over one month. Almost half the beds in the new Moscow clinic will be intensive care. The city's existing Kommunarka infectious diseases hospital is reported to be packed with 'elite' patients suffering from coronavirus or its symptoms. Health minister Murashko said that all hospitals may need to take coronavirus patients despite the massive efforts to build new capacity. He said: 'I'm very concerned by the state of the outpatient-polyclinic service. 'I would say that we have been training it practically on a daily basis, because it needs to be readjusted. This indeed is a special situation.'"
"Atlanta police are hunting for a woman who filmed herself coughing on a family with four children and saying 'corona' in what they believe to be a social media challenge. The female suspect allegedly targeted the family of six while they were out exercising in Atlantic Station on the evening of April 5. Police said the woman approached the four children and coughed on them, before saying the word 'corona' and laughing.  The suspect appeared to be holding a cellphone and using a video app at the time. Authorities believe she was filming the incident as part of a coronavirus social media prank,The Atlanta Journal-Constitutionreported. It comes amida disturbing trend of people playing pranks in public by claiming they are infected or coughing on people, just so they can get likes on social media. The woman disappeared on foot before the horrified parents could confront her, police said. The Atlanta Police Departmenthas released surveillance footage of the woman walking through a store holding a drink and shopping bag and are asking the public to help identify her. She is facing charges ofreckless conduct, which carries a penalty of up to 12 months in jail and a $1,000 fine. This is believed to be the latest in a string of sick pranks circulating on social media where people have filmed themselves coughing on people or on store produce for challenges and uploaded them under the hashtags#coronaviruschallenge or #coughingchallenge. Police are coming down hard on the pranksters, slapping them with terrorism charges, as the pandemic continues to ravage the US and devastate lives. Back in March, Virginia authorities warned of a 'disturbing trend' where young people were filming themselves coughing on food in grocery stores and posting it on social media. Videos showed a trend for one person coughing on goods while their accomplice reacts to it for the camera. Two teenagers in Virginiafilmed themselves coughing on produce in a Harris Teeter store on March 18 and uploaded the video to social media. Over in Missourri, a man allegedly recorded a video of himself saying 'who's scared of coronavirus?' before licking several items in a Walmart store. Cody Lee Pfister, 26, was tracked down after the footage surfaced on social media and he was charged with making a terrorist threat. A Texas teenager was then arrested and charged last week on terrorism charges after she posted a video on social media threatening to deliberately spread coronavirus in a Walmart store. Lorraine Maradiaga, 18,posted a series of videos on Snapchat where she said she had tested positive for the deadly virus, before she headed for the Dallas store and vowed to 'shorten your life'. 'I'm here at Walmart about to infest every m**********r, because if I'm going down, all you m***********s are going down,' the girl said in the video. The video later shows her in a car as she coughs into the camera. 'If you want to get the coronavirus and f****** die, call me,' she said in the video. 'I'll meet you up and (cough, cough) and I will shorten your life.' There has also been a spate of incidents not thought to be filmed but where individuals have deliberately targeted and coughed on people in public places. In Pennsyvlania, Daniel Tabussi, 57, was charged with terroristic threats, simple assault, disorderly conduct and harassment after he allegedly approached an older man in a Karns grocery store who was wearing a medical face mask and gloves and made deliberate coughing sounds near the man then smiled and laughed. He had reportedly mocked the man for wearing a mask and claimed he was infected with the coronavirus. A few days later, a man in New Jersey was charged with making terrorist threats after he allegedly coughed on a supermarket employee in a Wegman's supermarket in Manalapan claiming he was infected with the contagious coronavirus. George Falcone, 50, was charged forterrorist threats in the third degree and other charges after he leaned toward an employee and purposely coughed, laughing and saying he was infected with COVID-19. More than 27,000 Americans have been killed by the deadly virus and there are now more than 633,000 infections."

"Three women are being slammed as 'disgusting,' 'selfish,' and 'stupid' after taking a fun 'stroll' through Target because they were 'missing normal life.' Megan Jerrelle, 30, from South Carolina, posted about the girls' shopping trip on Facebook, writing that they were 'pretending life is normal' by spending an hour browsing Target for things like sunglasses. After countless social media users called her out for the dangerous behavior, she deleted the post — but followed it up with a rant calling stay-at-home orders 'nonsense' and insisting that 'a trip to target with your girlfriends' won't 'harm the public.' Megan shares photos from her fun shopping trip on Facebook, where Instagram accounts like TalkThirtyToMe took screenshots. 'Pretending life is normal for an hour while we stroll Target, purchase all the essentials like sunglasses and snacks,' she wrote, captioning a photo of herself and two friends, including another woman named Jackie Calvert. In the image, the three women, who don't live together, are all huddled close together to smile for the camera. 'We’re celebrating friendship and living our best life in spite of everything going on in the world right now,' she wrote. 'We were all feeling the feels of quarantine and missing normal life so we decided to create our version of fun together and it’s been so good for our souls. Grateful for our tribe and how we love each other in the good times and the seasons of struggle,' she concluded. The US government, most state governments, and experts from the CDC, WHO, and other health organizations have repeatedly warned the public to limit close contact with others. Americans have been urged to stay home and limit trips out to places like grocery stores. They've also been encouraged to practice social distancing by limiting contact with people outside of their household. All of these measures have been pushed to curtail the spread of the virus, which has so far killed at least26,094 Americans and128,011 people worldwide. The most recent count of total cases in the US is615,183, with nearly two million cases around the world. So when Megan shared her post, many social media users were furious. 'This is disgusting. Also, can we please stop saying “tribe,”' wrote one. 'The fact that they are dismissive of staying home AND used the word tribe,' complained another. One more accused them of 'putting cashiers like my sister in danger for the dumbest reasons,' while another said that in total, the three women have 'the collective brain power of a potato.' 'Aside from the dangerous level of stupidity and selfishness, can we as a just society decide that anyone who refers to their group of friends or like minded people they meet at Cochella, Burning Man, or Bonnaroo as their ""tribe"" that those people should be immediately fed to the closest active volcano?' asked another. The backlash proved great enough that Megan deleted the post — a big step for her, since she regularly posts about being anti-vaccine and gets plenty of backlash for that, too. But Megan, who also sells essential oils for the multi-level marketing company Young Living, followed up the post with a new one in which she ranted against her critics. 'Oohhh the hate we get for going against the norm,' she wrote. 'It’s a familiar space for me, I felt it when I decided to have a homebirth with my first baby. I felt it when I started speaking out against vaccines. I felt it yesterday when I posted a picture of my tribe getting ready to take Target by storm during a time when the government suggests we stay home. 'Here’s the thing guys, all of my BEST decisions have come from a place of EMPOWERMENT, not fear,' she went on. 'It’s uncomfortable for others because they haven’t done the work to be in the space so they’re afraid of it.I have compassion for that because I’ve been there too. 'But I don’t choose that space anymore and it’s FREAKING FREEDOM. 'The government can give me all the suggestions but I am always going to look at FACTS and make MY OWN decision, I’ll never blindly follow. Too woke for that nonsense. 'If you think the government is telling you to stay home because they truly care about your well-being, wake the EFF up,' she said. 'You’re not being told to stay home because a trip to target with your girlfriends is going to harm the public. THAT nonsense only makes sense if you DON'T think about it.' Her angry response was also screengrabbed before she switched her Facebook page to private. Megan has indicated in other social media posts that she is completely ignoring calls for social distancing. On March 27, she shared a smiling photo with her sister, who came to visit. 'She asked on Monday if she could drive down for a visit this week and I couldn’t have been more excited for her to come. God knew I needed her this week,' she wrote.⁣ 'Anyone else using this time to see family?' 'C o r o n a isn’t going to stop us from spending quality time with the ones we love, taking a walk, smiling at a strangers, appreciating nature’s beauty,' she wrote in another post."
"An eerie new video has captured coyotes freely roaming the streets of San Francisco, which remain empty amid the coronavirus pandemic. The recording shared on social media Tuesday features two wild dogs walking in the middle of the road at night. In the clip, the animals are heard howling back and forth to one another. The coyotes were outside Nick Delia's apartment on the corner of Greenwich and Powell in the North Beach area around midnight last week. The location is nearby playgrounds, parks and a street lined with businesses that have been closed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Never run away from a coyote or it will likely chase, The Humane Society of the United Statesadvises. HAZING METHODS Stand tall, wave your arms, and yell at the coyote, approaching them if necessary, until they run away. Noisemakers: Voice, whistles, air horns, bells, 'shaker' cans full of marbles or pennies, pots, lid or pie pans banged together Projectiles: sticks, small rocks, cans, tennis balls or rubber balls Other: hoses, water guns with vinegar water, spray bottles with vinegar water, pepper spray or bear repellent. In San Francisco there have been 987 cases of the virus and 15 deaths. In the state of California there are 25,779 cases and 790 deaths. The video has been widely shared online after many other coyote sightings in the city where some of 8,000 homeless people are still out on the streets after isolation hotel rooms and shelters filled up. Coyotes are spotted occasionally in urban areas of the Bay but the sightings have increased after the government urged people to stay home to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It's especially strict in San Francisco where the mayor has ordered people to only go out for essentials such as groceries. Authorities have advised people to make loud noises to scare the wild dogs away. A five-year-old girl was bitten at the Dublin Hills Regional park recently where she was just after 2pm with her family. Her mother had tried to shoo the pack of five or six coyotes away but one managed to bite the girl on the neck and has a laceration in the back that required sutures. 'I've been with the district since 2005 and to my knowledge, we haven't had a coyote attack a human being,' Doug Bell, Wildlife Program Manager with the East Regional Park District (EBRPD) said."
"World War II hero Captain Tom Moore has raised more than £10million for the 'brave nurses and doctors' of the NHS by marching around his garden on a zimmer frame. The 99-year-old had initially set out to raise £1,000 by walking 100 lengths of his 27-yard garden in Bedfordshire - but he has now smashed his target by 9,000 times in less than a week.The new figure stands at £10,081,469.54. Captain Moore, who was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, even caused his JustGiving page to crash this morning when 90,000 people rushed to sponsor him in his endeavour to support NHS heroes. He had aimed to complete the challenge and raise £1,000 for NHS Charities Together by his 100th birthday on April 30. However, he is currently ahead of schedule with2,430 yards complete and is hoping to finish his final 10 laps - or 270 yards - by Thursday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a personal thank you to Captain Moore during his daily coronavirus press briefing today.'Captain Tom, you're an inspiration to us all and we thank you,' he said. Speaking to Victoria Derbyshire as he reached the landmark £5million total this morning, Captain Moore said the achievement was 'completely out of this world' and thanked those who have donated. 'Thank you so much to all the people who have subscribed to the NHS because for every penny that we get, they deserve every one of them,' he said. He added that he never believed he would raise 'anything near that sort of money' when he began his sponsored walk on April 9. 'At no time when we started off with this exercise did we anticipate we'd get anything near that sort of money,' he said. 'It just shows that people have such high regard for matters of our National Health Service and it's really amazing that people have paid so much money.' His family added on Twitter: '5 MILLION! Huge thank you to @JustGiving who had over 90,000 people on Tom's page at one time, and had to try ensure that the site didn't crash. 'WOW - just speechless. #walkwithtom #tomorrowwillbeagoodday.' The total rocketed to £7million just hours later, with thousands in donations still being pledged. A few short hours after hitting the £7million mark, Captain Tom's family took to Twitter once more to celebrate hitting more than £8million. '8 MILLION POUNDS!!! I’m speechless..... This amount of money will help the #NHS beyond what we ever thought was imaginable. 'Thank you to everyone that’s helped me get there. '#walkwithtom #TomorrowWillBeAGoodDay.' Then another tweet appeared a short time after, when donations reached well over £9million. '9 MILLION POUND! NHS - we love you! Let’s clap loud tomorrow night...#walkwithtom. '#TomorrowWillBeAGoodDay.' Captain Moore, who lives inMarston Moretaine with his daughterHannah Ingram-Moore, son-in-law Colin Ingram and grandchildren Georgia and Benjie after his wife Pamela passed away,began his fundraiser to thank the 'magnificent' NHS staff who supported him through cancer and a broken hip. He was inspired by the 'amazing' treatment he continues to receive after falling and breaking his hip in 2018, and on his recovery from skin cancer. The mammoth total comes as Piers Morgan launched a campaign this morning for Captain Moore to be knighted for his extraordinary fundraising efforts. The presenter had donated £10,000 to the fundraiser on Monday. Speaking on Good Morning Britain, he said: 'It suddenly came to me – would it be nice to see Captain Tom Moore, who served his country in World War II, and has now raised over £4million for the NHS in a week, wouldn't it be great to see him knighted for his services to the country? 'Wouldn't it be great if we didn't feel temptation to give it to business people who pay money for the honour, we didn't give it to celebrities for singing nice songs, but we give it to someone like him? That we make him Sir Tom?' 'I think that would be great,' he added. 'Let's give him something back.' The bookies have also made it 5/6 that the 99-year-old will be honoured with a knighthood before the end of next year. Jessica O'Reilly of Ladbrokes said: 'Captain Tom's fundraising efforts are beyond incredible and he deserves to be honoured.' Hundreds of Britons have taken to social media in support of the grandfather-of-four, with one user even suggesting a hospital should be named after him. 'I'd like a NHS hospital named 'The Captain Tom Moore' hospital,' one woman said on Twitter. 'Outside should be a statue of him, in his blazer, with his badges with his zimmer frame as a reminder to us how much one person can do, even at his age, when they choose to act.' Another user added: 'That man is a legend and a HERO, 80 years ago and today in 2020.' 'This man is an inspiration, saved his country once, now helping save our health service now,' said a third. 'Sir Tom Moore has the best ring to it.' Carrie Symonds, thefiancée of prime minister Boris Johnson, dubbed Captain Moore a 'total hero' on Twitter this afternoon as his total neared £8million. Reegan Davies, an eight-year-old actress from South Wales, has also asked children across the UK to make 'our nation's hero' a virtual birthday card for when he turns 100 on April 30. Captain Tom Moore was conscripted into the British Army in June 1940 when he was 20, alongside all men aged 20 to 35. He began his military career in Otley, West Yorkshire, where he joined the 8th Battalion, the Duke of Wellington's Regiment under Lieutenant Lord George Saville. The Regiment was sent to train in Wadebridge, Cornwall where they were tasked with coastal defence amid a predicted German invasion. A young Captain Moore was soon promoted to Corporal and sent to the officer cadet training unit in Droitwich Spa. Here, he celebrated his 21st birthday after he passed as a Second Lieutenant. In August 1941, he was sent to the DWR headquarters in Halifax where he joined the 9th Battalion at Winchcombe. The infantry battalion then converted to an armoured regiment 146th Royal Armoured Corp, though themajority of the soldiers could not drive. In October, the unit was posted to Bombay, now Mumbai, in India. The journey took six weeks by sea, with a four-day delay in Freetown,Sierra Leone and a four-day stop in Cape Town. Captain Moore then took a train from Bombay to Poona, before arriving at Kirkee, a town now known asKhadki. The 9th DWR formed the 50th Indian Tank Brigade under the command of Brigadier Schreiber. Captain Moore was then asked by theBrigadier to start a motorcycling course for the Brigade due to his expertisefor the sport. The Brigade was then ordered to move to Calcutta - the road journey was in a monsoon and took three weeks. His Battalion was stationed in theLohardaga district nearRanchi. They then took part in two exercises in the Arakan before moving further east and south to Rangoon. Captain Moore was then sent on a course at theapproved vehicle depot in Bovington, England. He remained here as an instructor until it was closed. Dozens of children have responded, holding up brightly coloured cards with '100' and 'happy birthday' written on the front in photographs posted online. She said: 'I think Captain Tom is amazing and I really think when this is all over instead of having a letter from the Queen he should get to meet her or maybe the Queen can Skype him. 'He was was a war hero but now he's my hero and the nations.' The grandfather-of-four will celebrate his birthday with a virtual party with his family and friends amid the coronavirus lockdown. But the soon-to-be centenarian will have a 'huge celebration' once the pandemic has 'blown over.' Captain Moore trained as a civil engineer before enlisting in the army for the Second World War, rising to captain and serving in India and Myanmar. He went on to serve on the Arakan in south east Asia before he returned to Britain to become an instructor at theArmoured Fighting Vehicle School in Bovington. The veteran and his family set out to raise £1,000 initially, but as donations flooded in they decided to raise their target to £500,000. The fundraiser had topped £1million as of 9am on Tuesday, before surpassing £5million this morning and going on to raise another million hours later.The new figure stands at more than £8 million. 'It seems almost like fairy land to think that we started off at 1,000 to a sum of money that's not believable, is it?' Captain Moore said. 'Whereas in the last war we had soldiers in uniform in khaki, this time our army are in doctors and nurse's uniform. They're doing such a marvellous job.' The latest goal was comfortably beaten on Monday, with a quarter of a million supporters now having raised ten times the new target. Speaking on Tuesday, Captain Moore's daughter said: 'We have decided as a family we won't reset the target. We feel that we have shown a window into the world of a gem. Now the nation has taken this gem of a man into our hearts. 'We feel that it's now up to the British public to take this as far as it should go, Tom will continue to walk and we, the family and friends, will continue to support him, this is now in the hands of the British public.' Showing his gratitude for the overwhelming support Brits have seen him, the Second World War captain said: 'I would say thank you, very very much, you're so kind and it's such a benefit to many many people. 'You're giving hope to the people who are at the moment find it very, very difficult, but we shall survive and we shall get through it in the end.' On Monday, Piers Morgan donated £10,000 toward Captain Moore's cause and told the near-centenarian: 'Captain Tom Moore, thank you for serving your country. 'I'm so glad that we were able, through the brilliant NHS, to serve you back and keep you going. 'Good luck - I want to get you over the line today. Here's what I'm going to do, Tom, I'm going to put £10,000 of my own money into your fundraising today and I hope that encourages everyone watching at home to do the same. 'Little or small, whatever you can do. Let's get you over the half a million. You've got 10 grand from me.' The donation meant he had raised more than £400,000 - but 24 hours later, the total had more than doubled. The 99-year-old widow tweeted his thanks to Susanna Reid and Piers for having him on the show, adding: 'Piers - I salute you'. There have been other fundraisers set up to help support the NHS amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 12,868 people amid 98,476 cases in the UK. Ian Alcorn, a bathroom fitter from Nottingham, planned to raise £100 for the NHS coronavirus effort by encouraging friends and family to camp in their gardens, however his fundraiser quickly gathered over £100,000. As a way of entertaining his children, he set up a tent in his back garden, inviting a few friends and neighbours to join at home and donate £2 to NHS Charities Together. Mr Alcorn said: 'The basis of the idea stemmed from boredom at home, it was a Sunday night and I was waiting for Antiques Roadshow to come on. 'My wife's a key worker so there were some days we needed to fill and others not. I thought at the weekend, let's treat the kids to a camp-out. We couldn't go out so we would camp in the garden!' Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a personal thank you to Captain Moore during his daily coronavirus press briefing today. Mr Hancock paid tribute to the99-year-old army veteranduring his opening remarks at Downing Street. 'I want to start by thanking everyone who is staying at home even in this sunshine. 'Together, we are slowing the spread of this virus. 'I want to pay a special tribute to Captain Tom Moore, who at the age of 99 has raised over £7 million so far for NHS charities. 'Captain Tom, you're an inspiration to us all and we thank you,' he said. The new figure stands at more than £8 million."
"A controversial zoo in Thailand has caused outrage after forcing a chimpanzee to ride a bike while spraying coronavirus sanitizer. Footage from the Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo, on the outskirts of Bangkok, shows the chimp wearing a surgical face mask, denim shorts and anorange Hawaiian shirt as it pedals a children's bicycle with disinfectant tanks strapped to the back. Campaigners described the footage as 'heartbreaking'. At around one minute into the video, the chimp, who is chained to a wooden block, can be seen pulling on a nappy before a zoo worker hands over the human clothes. The video shows the chimp swerving around the zoo on a child's bike as disinfectant sprays out of the tank at the back. A zoo worker jogs alongside the wobbling bike while holding a lead chained to the chimp, as it struggles to maintain its balance. Towards the end of the video the zoo worker encourages the chimp to applaud its work. Animal rights group PETA described the treatment as 'heartbreaking' and said the zoo was a 'hell hole'. Spokesman Nirali Shah said: 'Places like Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo are hellholes where animals like this chimpanzee endure miserable lives in captivity every single day. 'They're routinely mistreated, and know little more than chains. When they're not used for human 'entertainment', they're held in cramped cages.' Zoo director Uthen Yangpraphakorn claimed the chimp was used to help clean the zoo in preparation for its re-opening once the government lifts coronavirus lockdown measures. Yangpraphakorn said: 'We have been closed since the government orders about the virus, so in the meantime we do not have much to do. 'We clean the place two or three times a week in case the government will allow us to re-open, so we are ready to start accepting visitors again. 'The chimp was also train in the farm so we just brought him out to let him stretch his limbs during this inactive period.' Campaigners have been trying unsuccessfully for several years to have the zoo closed after repeated claims of emaciated elephants being abused, bears stuck in filthy pools and malnourished crocodiles. PETA investigators say they have documented several accounts of abuse at the zoo last year including animals being beaten with bamboo sticks. Shah added: 'Despite multiple attempts to contact Samutprakarn, the zoo's management has never responded. 'PETA submitted the investigative findings to the Thai police and lodged an official complaint with authorities, urging them to inspect the zoo.' It is not the first time the zoo has sparked controversy. Last December footage emerged of a painfully thin elephant forced to perform tricks for crowds. Animal rights groups, including PETA, have since pressured tour companies to stop taking holidaymakers to the enclosure. Chinese firm Ctrip - Asia's biggest online booking agency that handles millions of holidaymakers a year - ditched the zoo in August 2019 and stopped selling tickets to the facility. The firm owns Skyscanner, Trip, and Tours4fun. Thailand has so far declared 2,643 coronavirus cases and 43 deaths. The country has enforced strict measures to combat the pandemic including closing zoos and other businesses, banning passenger flights, imposing curfews, sweeping travel bans and prohibiting alcohol."
"Andrea Bocelli's mesmerising Music For Hope live concert from the deserted Duomo di Milano has broken world records. The opera singer's Easter Sunday's performance has become the biggest live-streamed classical music event of all time, with a combined 35 million people viewing the 30-minute concert. The historic event reached over 2.8 million peak concurrent viewers, making it one of the biggest musical live stream performances of all-time and the largest simultaneous audience for a classical live stream in YouTube history. The video received more than 28 million views from across the globe in its first 24 hours. Bocelli’s extraordinary performance has since been covered in more than 100 countries worldwide, and continues to trend globally across YouTube and social media platforms. The staggering figures make it the biggest live-streamed classical music event of all time, as millions joined together remotely around the world. Bocelli commented: 'I am moved and delighted to have received such an overwhelming reaction, that has gone beyond our highest expectations. 'For an artist, the event is the reason for the sacrifices of a lifetime; for a believer and a Catholic as I am, it was further confirmation of the benevolent smile with which the Heavenly Father looks to his children. 'It was an immeasurable honour and privilege to lend my voice to the prayers of millions of people, gathered in a single embrace – a small, great miracle of which the whole world was the protagonist and which confirms my optimism about the future of our planet. 'Thanks to everyone who worked in the shadows for weeks, from management to the record label, and especially to all of those who have shared this moment with us, to stay truly united.' Bocelli's concert aimed to send 'love, healing and hope' toItaly amid the coronavirus crisis. The 61-year-old left viewers around the world in tears as they watched him perform from the deserted Duomo di Milano. Emotionally-charged fans praised Bocelli's powerful performance on social media as 'moving, mesmerising and magnificent!' Bocelli was granted exclusive access to the currently closed Milan cathedral by Archpriest Monsignor Gianantonio Borgonovo and Mayor Giuseppe Sala. The church has been shut off amid the pandemic but exclusively opened its doors for the opera star and organist Emanuele Vianelli. The outbreak has raged across Italy - particularly in the northern Lombardy region - killing 19,899 and infecting more than 150,000 since it took hold. But Italians hope they have passed the peak as 431 new deaths were reported by the civil protection service on Sunday - the lowest since March 19. The event was hosted byVeneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, a600-year-old organisation which supervises the building. For his performance, Bocelli was accompanied by Duomo di Milano's organist, Vianelli, while performing the likes of Ave Maria and Sancta Maria. Viewers from around the world flocked to social media to express their gratitude to the singer, who provided one of his most iconic performances to date. 'I can't help crying at the heartbreaking beauty of Andrea Bocelli alone in the great duomo, only empty seats in front of him. This moment in history is magnificent and utterly sad. Siamo con te, Italia,' wrote one person. 'Andrea Bocelli sang Amazing Grace just outside Duomo di Milano a few minutes ago. It was mesmerising,' tweeted another. Someone else admitted: ''Holy cow. Andrea Bocelli's Amazing Grace just now was one of the most remarkable things I've ever seen. Incredibly moving.' Thanking the tenor, one viewer tweeted: 'Andrea Bocelli singing alone inside Milan's empty Duomo is heartbreaking but so powerful and uplifting. Grazie #MUSICFORHOPE.' Ahead of his performance,Bocelli appeared solemn as he was photographed at the breathtaking cathedral, wearing a sleek black tux complete with bow tie. The tenor was without an audience due toItaly's lockdown and government regulations surrounding COVID-19 but the footage was streamed live to hisYouTube channel, and is set to be released digitally on audio streaming services within hours. Talking ahead of his performance, Bocelli said: 'On the day on which we celebrate the trust in a life that triumphs, I'm honoured and happy to answer ""Sì"" to the invitation of the City and the Duomo of Milan.' The opera singer added: 'I believe in the strength of praying together; I believe in the Christian Easter, a universal symbol of rebirth that everyone – whether they are believers or not – truly needs right now. 'Thanks to music, streamed live, bringing together millions of clasped hands everywhere in the world, we will hug this wounded Earth's pulsing heart, this wonderful international forge that is reason for Italian pride. 'The generous, courageous, proactive Milan and the whole of Italy will be again, and very soon, a winning model, engine of a renaissance that we all hope for.  'It will be a joy to witness it, in the Duomo, during the Easter celebration which evokes the mystery of birth and rebirth.' Mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, said: 'I am happy Andrea has accepted our invitation. This year, Easter will be very different for all of us. 'The joyous serenity that usually comes with this day, has been greatly troubled by the pandemic we are experiencing. 'I am sure that the extraordinary voice of Bocelli will be the embrace we are missing these days, a strong, special hug, capable of warming the heart of Milan, Italy and the world.' Archpriest of Duomo di Milano,Monsignor Gianantonio Borgonovo, added: 'Our 'Hallelujah' is an invitation that we placed in the ark forty days ago and that the flood, which has overwhelmed us all, almost made us forget the joy of expressing it on the day of Easter. 'The voice and word of Andrea Bocelli reminds us that the reason for our hope does not come from us but it is a gift that comes from God. 'This is what it means to promote, from our Duomo - the home of the people of Milan - and through the voice of Bocelli, the confidence that the Spirit of the Risen Crucifix will help us shape the days granted to us in the Kingdom of the One who wanted a new humanity, united and fraternal.' As well as the special concert,Bocelli is also currently fundraising with hisAndrea Bocelli Foundation (ABF) on GoFundMe to raise money forhospitals to protect their medical staff with equipment during theCOVID-19 emergency. So far Italy has seen 19,468 deaths and152,271 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Bocelli's special live Easter concert was streamed on hisYouTube channelfrom6pm UK time, on Sunday."
"A half-black, half-Asian beauty blogger has been racially abused by Chinese internet users because of her African origin amid rising discrimination against black people in China during the coronavirus crisis. Zhong Feifei, 24, has seen her social media pageflooded with pejorative comments and ethnic slurs in the past week since she was revealed to be a contestant in a Chinese TV show. Some people went as far as using the Chinese equivalent of the 'N-word' while others told her to 'go back to Africa'. The Boston University graduate first appeared to the public as a beauty blogger on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, before joining the reality show in China. China's warnings against 'imported' coronavirus cases have stirred up anti-foreigner sentiment among its people. African expats in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, have claimed to beevicted from their homes, banned from entering restaurants and turned away from hotels because the locals think they might have COVID-19. US and African officials have confronted China publicly and in private over racist mistreatment of black people. McDonald's had to close a chain in Guangzhou after it banned black people from entering. Mix-raced Zhong, a student, was recently selected as a contender for the Chinese competition show Produce Camp 2020, a spin-off of the popular South Korean reality programme Produce 101. Shewas born in the Liaoning Province of northern China to a Chinese mother and a Congolesefather, according to the press. She graduated from Boston University with a bachelor's degree in 2018 and is now completing a master course of intelligence and counterterrorism at Johns Hopkins University. The 24-year-old vlogger is among the 100 female trainees who will compete with each other in the reality show to fight for a position in a new idol group. The first season of the reality show series, which was aired in 2018, amassed over 1.8billion views within the first four episodes, Chinese media report. It remains disclosed when the new Produce Camp 2020 will be broadcasted. While the trainees have been building up their fan bases since the announcement, Ms Zhong is forced to deal with a storm of racial attacks due to her African heritage. Some Chinese web users even commented on her social media posts with a translation of the derogatory 'N-word'. One comment read: 'Go back to Africa please, thanks.' Another one said: 'Has the beauty standard in China become so international that now we will have idol groups with black girls?' Supporters of the contestant, who has over 31,000 followers on her Chinese Twitter-like Weibo, have been leaving Ms Zhong positive messages in a response to the racial attacks. One commenter wrote: 'Sister, don't care about the trash. You are so beautiful! I fell in love with you at first sight. Keep going!' Another one read: 'A bunch of grown-up men to attack a girl because of her skin tone is utterly shameful.' As China prepares for a second wave of COVID-19 cases to hit their cities, black people living in the country said they've been discriminated against and faced racism, particularly in the southern city Guangzhou. A U.S. Embassy security alert on Saturday said that 'police ordered bars and restaurants not to serve clients who appear to be of African origin,' and local officials have launched mandatory testing and self-quarantine for 'anyone with 'African contacts'.' Some Africans have even described being suddenly evicted from their homes. Africans in Guangzhou also claimed they have shunned by others in public and targeted for additional COVID-19 tests without ever seeing the results. A McDonald's restaurant in China has come under fire after banning black people from entering the store out of fears that they might be coronavirus carriers. A video recently circulating online showed a customer holding a sign that read: 'We've been informed from now on black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant.' The store is believed to be located in the southern Chinese city Guangzhou. The footage sparked uproar online after the fast-food chain was accused of fuelling the rising xenophobia, particularly towards African nationals, in the country. McDonald's said the notice 'is not representative of our inclusive values'. The US fast-food giant has temporarily closed the branch, according to a statement."
"As the coronavirus pandemic has left the nation with no choice but to stay inside, people are spending their new-found free time deep cleaning their houses - and clearing out their attics. While some people from across the globe are taking inspiration from Marie Kondo and getting rid of all things that don't spark joy, others are revelling in the nostalgia of their old possessions - including Blockbuster membership cards, old iPod's and phones.

"A second Chinese city has banned its residents from eating dogs and cats with a new law in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Zhuhai, a city bordering Macau with a population of 1.7 million, issued the order in line with a government's proposal which lists dogs as 'companion animals', an official told state media. Shenzhen is the first Chinese city to bar pet meat from the dining table. It is situated across the Pearl River estuary from Zhuhai. The two cities, both in the southern province of Guangdong, will enforce the ban from May 1. Zhuhai officials announced the decision at a press conference yesterday, reported state-run China News. Yong Ling, the supervisor of the legal affairs committee of the Standing Committee of People's Congress of Zhuhai Municipality, said lawmakers must adhere to the country's Directory of Genetic Resources of Livestock and Poultry to decide what types of meat is legal to be traded and eaten. Because dogs and cats were not included a drafted version of the directory, the city decided to forbid the consumption of them, Yong added. Offenders will face a fine of up to 20 times the value of the meat, according to the law, according to another report from Xinhua. The move is part of a wider ban on the trading of wild animals in Zhuhai to ensure food safety in response to the coronavirus crisis. The city will prohibit all restaurants, hotels and farms from selling exotic meat from May 1. Scientists believe that the novel coronavirus was passed to humans from wild animals sold as food in a market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China. COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed more than 130,000 people and infected more than two million worldwide since an outbreak emerged in December. China's last major health crisis, the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, was also linked to the consumption of wild animals. The SARS virus killed 775 people globally and was later found in civets, a small cat-like mammal, sold in markets in Guangdong. Last week, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs excluded dogs from farm animals in a drafted directive. The authority said it recognises dogs as 'companion animals' and 'not suitable' to be managed as livestock in the document released on April 8. Only the animals officially listed as livestock or poultry can be bred, raised, traded and transported for commercial purposes in China, according to China's Animal Husbandry Law. This means the proposal can potentially prevent around 10 million dogs being killed for their meat every year in the country. The annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival, held every year on the summer solstice, is one of the most controversial food festivals in China. It sees thousands of dogs cruelly killed, skinned and cooked with blow-torches before being eaten by the locals. Animal welfare organisations have expressed their support for the pet meat ban in Zhuhai. Wendy Higgins, a spokesperson of Humane Society International, called it 'thrilling news for all those in China and around the world who have campaigned for so long to end this brutal trade.' She told MailOnline: 'Coming so soon after Shenzhen's ban and the government's historic statement classifying dogs as pets, we hope this is the start of a domino effect of progressive legislation across China with other cities following suit.' She also pointed out that 'most people in China don't eat dogs and cats'. 'So now it would seem that in the absence of a national ban, cities are taking matters into their own hands and reflecting the mood of the people,' she added. Shenzhen announced it will ban its residents from eating dog and cat meat on April 1 after passing a drafted law the day before. The city has around 13 million residents and borders Hong Kong."
"A group of live-streamers have faced backlash after filming macaques playing with pregnancy test strips in a scenic spot in China. Social media footage captures a monkey ripping apart the packaging of a test kit with its teeth while another visitor dropping a huge bag of marshmallows to feed the wild monkeys at the Qianling Mountain Park. Horrified Chinese web users have called for a boycott of such live-streaming hosts who are criticised as ‘morons with poor taste’. The nature park said that it’s difficult for them to intervene and ‘determine whether the live-streamers’ actions indeed cause harm to the macaques.’ The scenic spot, located in the south-western Chinese city Guiyang, is a natural habitat to hundreds of wild monkeys. Tourists were allowed to feed the monkeys before the coronavirus outbreak, according to the press. Local authorities banned the activity in late March and advised visitors to keep three metres (nine feet) away from the wild animals. But recently emerged clips show live-streamers handing pregnancy test strips to the animals to play with, while another monkey is seen ripping apart the packaging of a test kit with its teeth. The live-streamers, who appeared to try to attract their audience with the videos, remain unidentified. It is also unclear when the videos were filmed. A manager from the nature park, known by his surname Zhang, confirmed such incidents with the local press. ‘Because it’s hard for us to determine whether the live-streamers’ actions indeed cause harm to the macaques,’ Mr Zhang told Pear Video. ‘If it is harmful then the police would get involved. ‘When they act like ordinary visitors, you have no idea what their intentions are. You can’t just ban them from entering the park. ‘If we see one, we will remove them. Sometimes they would just run away if they see us approaching,’ the manager added. Outraged web users have also called for a boycott of such social media influencers and slammed them as ‘morons with poor taste’. One comment read: ‘Live-stream hosts with poor taste! They need to be banned as soon as possible.’ Another one wrote: ‘To all the social media platforms, please pay attention to these rubbish live-streamers. They have never done any good than doing outrage things to grab attention!’ The novel coronavirus, which was first found in Wuhan, is widely believed to be originated in bats. But scientists are still trying to unravel several key aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including how the virus was initially transmitted to a human. China has banned all trade and consumption of wildlife, a practice believed to be responsible for the country's deadly virus epidemic. It comes as a second Chinese city has banned its residents from eating dogs and cats with a new law in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Zhuhai, a city bordering Macau with a population of 1.7 million, issued the order in line with a government's proposal which lists dogs as 'companion animals', an official told state media.

Last week, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs excluded dogs from farm animals in a drafted directive.

The global tally of infections has topped 2million and the deadly disease has claimed at least 130,680 lives."
"DJ Jazzy Jeff has spoken to Will Smith about his battle with suspected coronavirus for the first time. The musician, 55, discussed his agonising illness after contracting pnenumonia in both lungs, which he believes to be COVID-19, with longtime BFF and collaborator Will, 51, onWednesday's episode of his new Snapchat series, Will From Home - teased on People.  Summertime hitmaker Jeff said he developed coronavirus-like symptoms at the end of last month, saying: 'I came home from my trip. I was like, ""I feel like I'm coming down with something"" and got into bed, and I don't remember the next 10 days. 'I had a temperature that reached 103. I had the chills. I lost sense of smell. I lost sense of taste.' Will responded: 'And you couldn't even get tested!' to which Jeff responded:'They gave me a flu test. And when I went and got the chest X-ray, she came in and said, ""You have pneumonia in both your lungs""'.  He added: 'Unfortunately, people think we're at the end [of the pandemic], and I think we're really at the beginning.' Discussing how he was alerted to Jeff's illness, Oscar nominee Will said: 'Lynette [Jeff's wife] called me and Lynette doesn't panic and she called with panic vibes.' Jeff, known for his music collaborations with Will as DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince in the 1990s, broke the news of his illness to his fans last month via Instagram stories. He wrote: 'I'm recovering from pneumonia in both my lungs 'I lost my sense of smell and taste which is a main sign of the virus. I would NOT be here if not for my guardian angel for a wife!' He added: 'Pls say a prayer for all the sick… it's a lot more than you know!!' He had first hinted he was sick on March 7 when he tweeted:‘I’ll be happy when I’m home and I can cough freely…LOL,’ presumably receiving treatment in hospital. Will teamed up with Jazz, real name Jeffrey Townes, when they were both trying break into the big time in West Philadelphia's local hip hop scene in the 1980s. They became local stars after adding the now forgotten beatboxer Clarence 'Ready Rock C' Holmes to the line-up, though he ended up splitting in 1990 before later unsuccessfully suing his old pals. They won a Grammy for best rap performance in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand, bu their biggest hit was Summertime, which also won a Grammy and reached as high as number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jeff made multiple appearances on Will's iconic sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince have managed to sell 5.5 million albums in the United States alone."
"A psychologist and mother-of-two has shared her tips for parents who are struggling to homeschool their children and manage their anxieties while quarantined amid the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking with DailyMailTV from her New York City home,Dr. Alli Kert, 43, assured parents that 'it is OK not to be on your A-game' as they try to adjust to the new normal in their households. 'I think first and foremost we need to manage our expectations,' she advised. 'Keep in mind that the routine is there to help structure our day, not to create stress.' Dr. Kert said her own children get up and get dressed every morning as if they were going to school. They have a smallfamily meeting at 8:30 a.m. to discuss their game plan before starting their day. 'There are days where it goes swimmingly and other days where everyone seems to be getting very frustrated,' she explained. 'So we just try and take a beat when that happens.' While many people are stressing about their children's schooling at home, the psychologist noted that children will be likely to learn more from how their parents navigate the global crisis. 'The most valuable lessons during all this will less likely be from the remote learning and will more likely be from observing how we recover from our less-than-stellar moments as parents,' she said. 'We need to be flexible both for ourselves and for our kids.' Dr. Kert shared that she has been less stringent with her kids' screen time over the past month, and she suggested other parents would benefit from following suit. 'My kids are on screens a lot more than they ever are,' she admitted, noting that they have also been given access to a lot more educational programming. 'I think we need to be flexible and also provide certain allowances for our kids that we may not have ordinarily allowed.' She did, however, stress that parents should still be 'vigilant' about what their children 'are doing and watching online.' Dr. Kert also shared advice on how parents can manage their children's anxiety during these trying times, insisting that there is 'no right way to feel.' Manage Expectations Dr. Kert said parents need to understand that they don't need to be on their 'A-game' as they try totry to adjust to the new normal in their households during the global crisis. Be Flexible The psychologist advised parents to be flexible for both themselves and their kids. If a homeschooling session is particularly frustrating, they should take a break instead of forcing it. Stick to a Routine Dr. Kert said children should have a daily routine while quarantined at home, but that doesn't mean parents should drive themselves crazy. 'Keep in mind that the routine is there to help structure our day, not to create stress,' she noted. Extra Screen Time Dr. Kert made it clear that now is not the time to be stringent about screen time. She admitted her own kids are in front of screens more than they have ever been, noting there is more educational content being offered to them. She did, however, stress that parents should still be 'vigilant' about what their children 'are doing and watching online.' 'I think our kids are hearing a lot of scary things right now,' she said. 'So we want to help them understand that while these things can happen, that doesn't mean they will happen.' She warned that parents should try and avoid having news shows on in communal areas of the home during the pandemic. 'Exposing our kids to the constant news cycle, whether it's online or on a TV in the background, can really exacerbate any anxiety they might be having,' she explained. Dr. Kert has found creative ways to keep the lines of communication open with her own children and help ease their fears. 'We've been having family game nights, which is really nice, and cooking competitions,' she said. 'We're acknowledging how worrisome this can be for them, while at the same time assuring them that we're doing everything we can to try and keep our family safe.' She also suggested that parents ask questions such as 'What do you think this is about?' and 'Why do you think we're here' to gather information and find out what they have been hearing. As for teenagers, she said it's important 'to give them the space they need,' while also 'beingavailable to them when they're ready to connect.' Dr. Kert said one of the best things parents can do if they sense their child is struggling with fear is to temper their own anxieties. 'I think one of the ways we can help manage our kids' anxieties is being aware of our own anxieties, so that, when we are with our kids, we can be a calm version of ourselves.'"
"Arizona governor Doug Ducey says his state is willing to host all 30 major league teams at the time public health concerns allow, which eventually could lead to the start of the baseball season primarily in empty spring training ballparks. MLB and the players' association have had preliminary discussion of potential ways for the season to start if given the go-ahead by federal, state and local governments and health officials. Having all teams based in the Phoenix area is among the contingency plans being examined. There are 10 spring training parks plus the Diamondbacks' Chase Field, which has a retractable roof, and several college facilities. 'Arizona, at the right time, is very open minded to hosting whatever Major League Baseball would like from the state,' Ducey, a Republican, said Tuesday. 'At the time that it would be appropriate for public health, if Arizona were in a position to reopen, we have the facilities that are here.' 'We have the hotel space that is here,' he said. 'We all want to make certain that the metrics and the data are proper before we're able to go forward, but I think two words that would allow the country and the state of Arizona to know that things were headed back to normal would be: Play ball!' MLB also said Tuesday it is cutting the salary of senior staff by an average of 35 percent for this year due to the new coranvirus' impact on the season. MLB is guaranteeing paychecks to its full-time employees of its central office through May. With no clarity on when the shutdown will end, players and staff intently follow the daily developments. 'I think we're all concerned that there's not going to be a season,' Texas Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. 'I don't know when it's going to be safe, I think the virus will let us know. If that means that we start in June, July, August or not at all, we definitely are all kind of concerned that we may not be able to play this year, and that's a reality.' Ducey said he had spoken with Commissioner Rob Manfred about the all-Arizona option. 'There's a number of different scenarios,' the governor said. 'I think the first scenario that was talked about was the idea of these clubs coming, being in hotels and in a way, having their own stay-at-home orders whether it either be at the hotel, or inside the stadium, without fans. ... It's something that Arizona is open minded to, and I'm open minded to.' Another potential option is splitting teams between the two spring training leagues: Arizona's Cactus League and Florida's Grapefruit League. Arizona's advantage is that it has 10 spring training ballparks and Chase Field all within about 50 miles. Florida's spring training ballparks are spread by as much as 220 miles. 'It allows for immediacy of a schedule, where you might be able to begin it and televise it, provide Major League Baseball to America,' said Scott Boras, baseball's most prominent agent. 'I think players are willing to do what's necessary because I think they understand the importance of baseball for their own livelihoods and for the interest of our country and providing a necessary product that gives all the people that are isolated enjoyment.' Many players and staff are concerned about the potential of a long absence from family while sequestered. Minnesota catcher Mitch Garver wondered how the plan would work, 'Where do we live? Who's allowed to come with us? Are we only allowed to go to the field and back to the hotel? What kind of hotel? What kind of accommodations are we working with? Is there going to be meal money?' he said. 'Then you get into player health, and we're talking about playing in 120 degree weather on spring training fields potentially living out of a visiting locker room.' Manfred announced the salary cut Tuesday in a memorandum to staff, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. Manfred also said the commissioner's office will make all planned distributions to teams through May. 'As part of our effort to protect the organization, my senior staff and I have decided to reduce our compensation by an average of 35 percent for 2020 to help the organization weather this terrible storm,' Manfred wrote in the memo, which described cost-cutting efforts. 'As a result of these developments, I am pleased to be in a position to ensure that all employees that received regular pay checks in April will continue to be paid through May 31,' he wrote. 'I am deeply grateful to the owners for supporting my decision to continue to support all of our employees in an environment where the owners and the clubs are facing their own very difficult financial issues.' MLB's season was to have started March 26, and teams agreed to advance $170 million to players in salary for the first 60 days of the season. As part of the deal, players agreed to give up claims to the remainder of their roughly $4 billion in salary if no games are played, Manfred wrote in his memo 'we are considering and analyzing a number of possibilities.' 'Only one decision, however, has been made with respect to the 2020 season: Major League Baseball will return to the field only when public health officials agree that it is appropriate to play and when we are convinced that our return to the field is safe for players, employees and fans,' he wrote. 'Moreover, we will never, in an effort to begin play, divert resources that are more appropriately devoted to public health initiatives and health care.' Manfred said his finance leaders have worked with department heads and have 'cut programs, canceled events, delayed capital expenditures and renegotiated contracts with vendors.' 'The savings realized have been crucial to our ability to maintain normal operations in other areas,' he added. Manfred called the distributions to teams 'a vital part of our economic system.' 'Clubs rely on these distributions to meet local obligations and to support the financing vehicles that provide much needed liquidity,' he wrote. 'We have informed the clubs that we will be making all of the scheduled distributions for April and May. These distributions will assist the Clubs in paying the salary advances that are being made to players under our recent agreement with the MLBPA.'"
"Australian consumer group CHOICE has listed the DIY home renovation projects you should never attempt to complete yourself - regardless of how much spare time you might have while isolating. Some home projects are dangerous for the average, unqualified man or woman and under Australian legislation, it is also illegal to conduct most electrical and plumbing tasks unless you're a qualified or licensed professional. It is also still legal for a tradesman can enter a household to complete necessary and essential jobs like plumbing emergencies if required. Installing an under bench dishwasher The first job CHOICE listed that is best to avoid is installing a new under bench dishwasher, as these household products can be difficult to correctly put into place. Under bench dishwashers can also be dangerous to install yourself since the device uses both water and electricity. The director of reviews and testing, Matthew Steen, said: 'You need to ensure these types of dishwashers are anchored properly, so they don't tip forward when you load and unload.' Bolting an appliance onto a wall of the house Mounting certain items on walls can be challenging and is often a two-person job - such as bolting large television sets in place. If done incorrectly, there is also a high chance of causing damage to either the wall or the appliance. 'There are a large number of appliances that you could install yourself, but it's always better to get someone else to help if you're outside your comfort zone,' Matthew said. Prior to deciding to mount an appliance onto a wall yourself, CHOICE recommends thoroughly considering your knowledge on the task at hand and your practical abilities. 1. Installing an underbench dishwasher 2. Installing a rangehood 3. Bolting an appliance such as a TV to a wall 4. Installing or servicing an air-conditioning unit 5. Installing a gas cooktop 6. Sanding floors 7. Fixing a roll-up garage door 8. Fixing a broken phone-line socket 9. Removing or repairing chipped lead-based paint 10. Installing dashcams, reversing cameras or a car stereo Source: CHOICE Installing or servicing an air-conditioning unit Unless you have a portable air-conditioning unit, you will need to call a licensed professional to install or service your air-conditioner. 'Air conditioner installers will also be able to advise you on the right capacity air conditioner for your needs,' CHOICE wrote. Although, cleaning a wall mounted air-conditioner is something you can do yourself, if possible. Sanding floorboards 'If you've ever seen someone try and use a floor sander for the first time then you know it can go horribly wrong very quickly,' said CHOICE's household and whitegoods expert, Ashley Iredale. While watching someone use a floor sander may look easy, it's far more difficult than expected – especially if you haven't used one before. 'If you don't hold on tight, it can take off across the room and punch a hole in your wall,' Ashley said. 'There's no reason not to give it a go if you know what you're doing, but you'd better know what you're doing!'"
"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in Arizona discovered two migrants hidden in the trunk of a car after they had unlawfully crossed the Mexico-United States border on Sunday. CBP said in a statement released Tuesday that agents assigned to an immigration checkpoint on state Route 85 nearGila Bend conducted the search of a Buick sedan with a sniffer dog. During the investigation, the Border Patrol officers found that a 39-year-old woman from Phoenix was smuggling the two undocumented individuals. The Honduran migrants were immediately processed and deported to Mexico. CBP said the driver of the vehicle was arrested and could be charged with human trafficking. The federal law enforcement agency said it has expedited the deportation of individuals who are caught entering the United States without legal documentation after the government set up several command stations near the American side of the Mexico-U.S. border. The so-called 'one-stop' centers have been operating since dating back to March 14. Under Title 42, CBP is allowed to expel some immigrants through ports of entry instead of transporting them to Border Patrol stations. The decision, the agency said, eliminates the risk of detained undocumented immigrants contracting COVID-19. 'Despite traditional risks of human beings being stuffed into a trunk, there's now increased risk due to exposure to coronavirus,' said Tucson Sector Border Patrol Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Michele Morales. 'These human smuggling tactics increase exposure risks for our agents, those they smuggle, and endanger the safety of the American people.'"
"A collection of early Apple Watch prototypes have been acquired by an Italian tech researcher and collector. Giulio Zompetti in Milan, Italy purchased four prototype models of the Apple Watch that he believes predate the original's 2015 release. Zompetti says he bought the prototypes from an e-waste facility, but declines to name the specific company or location. The prototypes come in a number of slightly different sizes, suggesting Apple was experimenting with just how big to make the final design. The watches all have small QR codes on them, as well as a unique ovular logo that is a hallmark of Apple's prototype devices, suggesting there's a good chance the models are genuine , according to a report in Vice. None of the prototypes are currently functioning, but Zompetti intends to repair and sell them just as he has with other Apple prototypes he's acquired, including test versions of iPhones and MacBooks. The prototypes also show Apple experimenting with different configurations for the heart rate sensors built into the back of the Apple Watch. These sensors use a process called photoplethysmography to measure each pulse of blood as it passes through the vessels in a person's wrist. For general background monitoring, the watch uses infrared LED lights, which are reflected back from blood as it expands and contracts in the vessels. For specific apps that use heart rate as a main feature, such as Apple's relaxation app Breathe, the device switches to a set of green LED lights, which are absorbed by blood instead of reflected. To ensure the heart rate sensors were accurate, Apple designed this LED system to dynamically adapt to a variety of different circumstances to ensure accurate readings, including flashing the LED lights more or or less often, and adjusting the brightness of each flash. The prototypes show several different arrangements for this sensing system, including LED lights arranged in a cross, and in a straght line, suggesting it took some effort to settle on a final design. While Apple maintains notoriously tight security measures on its product development efforts, prototypes of products nearing a final release can see hundreds and potentially even thousands of units produced for testing. Fitness trackers such as Fitbits or smart watches monitor heart rate using a technique calledphotoplethysmography. The tracker sends green light through the skin which is partially absorbed by arteries. As you exercise, these arteries expand as blood flow increases - meaning more green light is absorbed rather than reflected back to the tracker. The tracker estimates your heart rate by seeing how much light is reflected back. The amount of light that passes back through the skin to the tracker can be affected by the amount of melanin in the skin, and any tattoos. One of the key measuring tools of wearable sleep monitors is called actigraphy which has been used in medical sleep tests for decades. Actigraphy records movement through a measuring device called an accelerometer. The idea is that a certain amount of movement will be recorded as 'awake' and periods of being still corresponds with being 'asleep'. Sleep trackers with a heart rate tracking feature can measure your variations in heart rate to assess sleep quality and other parameters. Trackers that measure the body's core temperature use this information to predict stress levels and fertility, for example. "
"Google may be gearing up to power its line of phones and laptops with a processor made in-house. According to a report from Axios, Google's development of a processor for Pixel phones and Chromebooks could materialize a chip as soon as early next year and could help the tech giant support on-board artificial intelligence. The chip is reportedly code-named 'Whitechapel' and may be an eight-core ARM processor made using method developed by Samsung. The chip may reportedly be engineered partially to improve machine-learning capabilities and help improve the company's Google Assistant. Google currently makes some chips for its hardware, including one featured in its flagship Pixel 4 called Soli that uses radar to enable remote hand gesture controls. As noted by The Verge, it also makes the Titan M chip which is designed to bolster security on the Pixel. Currently, however, Qualcomm makes the primary processor in Pixel devices. By transitioning to its own chip, Google would mirror one of its biggest competitors, Apple, which designs its own line of A-series processors for the iPhone. Upon the release of its newest chip, the A13 Bionic, last September, Apple said that its processor is capable of crunching 1 trillion operations per second, making it 20 percent faster than the A12 while also being more efficient. By utilizing hundreds of voltage and clock gates and machine learning, the A13 can shut off different parts of the chip when they're not in use, making it exceptionally good at conserving energy. The result is a chip that helps conserve battery life and also increases computing power. If Apple's success is any indication, Google may be able to amp up subsequent phones and computers' speed and overall functionality."
"An incredible photograph has captured the moment the planets Mars, Saturn and Jupiter aligned above a waning Pink Moon just before dawn this morning. The juxtaposition — the closest the three planets will appear to be until 2022 — was captured over the village ofCobham, in the borough of Gravesham, Kent, England. While really millions of miles apart, from our perspective here on Earth the planets will remain 'lined up' until Tuesday as the Moon appears to pass them by. Scroll down for video Joining the lined-up planets, the Moon appeared today to pass within 2° of both Saturn and Jupiter — and tomorrow will see it pass within2° of Mars in turn. Today's arrangement follows on from a line-up of the four bodies together on Tuesday morning, in front of the stellar constellations of Capricorn and Sagittarius. With the full moon having been last week, the satellite has been rising later each day — meaning that it is also late to set and visible over the eastern horizon before dawn. This week the moon will be around243,000 miles (390,000 km) away from the Earth, while Mars lies 125 million miles (200 million km) out, Jupiter at 473 million miles (761 million km) away, and Saturn 936 million miles (1.51 billion km) distant. For those hoping to spot the final line-up of the three planets in the early hours of tomorrow morning, one is advised to look for the lights that — unlike stars — do not appear to 'twinkle' in the night sky. This effect is caused by the interference of the light from the stars from the Earth atmosphere — an impact which is less pronounced on the brighter and closer planets that make up our solar system. The alignment of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn was not the only event to grace the heavens today. At 2:02 AM, the recently-discovered asteroid #2020GH flew close by Earth, passing within around 212,360 miles (341,760 kilometres) of the planet. However, at only 82 feet (25 metres) in diameter, this visitor to our neighbourhood would not have been visible in the night sky to the naked eye. The phenomenon, known as the 'Pink Moon', earns its name from the flowering of the brightly-coloured herb 'moss pink,' which typically coincides with its arrival. It’s also known as the Egg Moon, Sprouting Grass Moon, Growing Moon or Full Fish Moon. The name comes from the Herb moss pink phlox, or 'wild ground' phlox, which blooms in early spring in the US andCanada. In the Northern Hemisphere, the April full moon lines up with the blooming of one of spring's earliest-flowering plants – wild ground phlox, or 'moss pink'. The pink moon, which is also known as the grass moon and the egg moon, was given its moniker by Native Americans, who provided a name for each full moon to help them keep track of time. Native Americans have a name for the full moon of every month in the calendar, including Wolf Moon for January, Snow Moon for February and Worm Moon for March – then Flower Moon in May. Strawberry Moon is for June, Buck Moon is for July and Sturgeon Moon is for August.

"Incredible high-definition snaps show the International Space Station as a tiny speck as it passes in front of the Sun. The ISS, which is the largest object ever put into space by humanity at 357 feet long, looks like a fly as it zooms in front of the perfectly round orange star. The images were captured by Mehmet Ergün, based in Germany, who has a lifelong interest in astrophotography. Ergün used a powerful telescope attached to a camera to capture 34 individual frames as the orbiting ISS crossed between planet Earth for less than one second. The images are then collated so the craft can be seen racing from one edge of the Sun to another in a short animation. The tiny satellite-shaped spacecraft looks like a miniature model as it’s seen racing from one side of our glowing orange Sun to the other. Scroll down for video ‘The Sun moved very quickly because I use a high focal length and small sensor,’ said Ergün. ‘Astrophotography is a compelling hobby inspired by all the beautiful objects the universe has to offer.’ The passionate space photographer took three weeks to plan the mission and travelled 30 miles from his home in Rheinbollen, Germany, to capture the perfect sighting of the ISS. The stargazer, who only bought his first telescope 10 years ago, has also captured detailed images of the Moon, the Milky Way and faraway nebulas. 'Around 2010 I bought my first telescope with which I had my first practical experience in astronomy,’ Ergün says on his website. ‘I wanted to share the fascinating sight with my family and friends, which gave me the desire to capture these moments photographically. ‘So it happened that a short time later I started to study astrophotography more intensively. I discovered how colourful our universe really is.’ The images capture the Sun'schromosphere – the second of three layers in the star's atmosphere, literally translating as 'the sphere of colour'. In the chromosphere, the temperature rises to about 36,000°F (20,000°C), and at these higher temperatures hydrogen emits light that gives off a reddish colour, known as an H-alpha emission. When the Sun is viewed through a spectrograph or a filter that isolates the H-alpha emission, new details on its surface can be observed. The ISS – which is in low earth orbit around 253 miles (408km) from Earth – has been continuously occupied since November 2000. NASA says anyone can sometimes see the ISS’s distinctive solar panels if they look up at the sky at dawn or dusk, even if they live in a big city. The space agency has a list of locations online where people can watch the ISS pass overhead. 'It is the third brightest object in the sky and easy to spot if you know when to look up,' NASA says. 'Visible to the naked eye, it looks like a fast-moving plane only much higher and travelling thousands of miles an hour faster.' The station’s orbital path takes it over 90 percent of the Earth’s population, travelling about 17,000 miles per hour at an equivalent distance to the Moon and back in about a day. The International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (£80 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. It has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000. Research conducted aboard theISSoften requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen. ISS studies have investigatedhuman research,space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology. The US space agency, Nasa, spends about $3 billion (£2.4 billion) a year on the space station program, a level of funding that is endorsed by the Trump administration and Congress. A U.S. House of Representatives committee that oversees Nasa has begun looking at whether to extend the program beyond 2024. Alternatively the money could be used to speed up planned human space initiatives to the moon and Mars."
"A team of retirees that scours the remote ravines and windswept plains of the Pacific Northwest for long-forgotten pioneer orchards has rediscovered 10 apple varieties that were believed to be extinct, but they may not be able to sell them on due to the coronavirus pandemic. EJ Brandt and David Benscoter, the Vietnam veteran and former FBI agent who make up the nonprofit Lost Apple Project, recently learned they'd unearthed their largest number ever in a single season after they sent their finds to Temperate Orchard Conservancy in Oregon, where all the apples are sent for study and identification. The apples positively identified as previously 'lost' were among hundreds of fruits collected in October and November from 140-year-old orchards tucked into small canyons or hidden in forests that have since grown up around them in rural Idaho and Washington state. However their nonprofit took a major hit when they had to cancel both an annual fair where they sell newly grafted 'lost' apple trees and a class on how to graft wood to grow a new apple tree because of the new coronavirus. The two events fund much of their $10,000 annual budget that goes toward travel costs, apple shipping and apple identification. Streaked Pippin Found:Waitsburg, Washington Gold Ridge Found: Pomeroy, Washington Sary Sinap (ancient apple from Turkey) Found: Latah County, Idaho Butter Sweet (of Pennsylvania) Found:Latah County, Idaho Colman Found: Latah County, Idaho Claribel Found: Latah County, Idaho Milalfyi Found: Pullman, Washington Nelson Sweet Found: Seattle, Washington Fink Found:Boise, Idaho 'Two months ago, I was thinking: ""This is going to be great. We've got 10 varieties that have been rediscovered,"" but .... right now, we couldn't pay our bills,' Benscoter said. Still, the self-described apple detectives take comfort in their work as they navigate today´s unprecedented times and find inspiration in imagining the lives of the pioneers who planted these trees. About 25% of homesteads didn't make it, Brandt said, and many settlers died or simply walked away to avoid starvation. 'It was a hard life. I can´t even imagine what they went through, but they survived and they went on with their lives,' he said. 'It's hard now, too, but it's going to be OK. It's all a part of life.' Each fall, Brandt and Benscoter spend countless hours and log hundreds of miles searching for ancient - and often dying - apple trees across the Pacific Northwest by truck, all-terrain vehicle and on foot. They collect hundreds of apples from long-abandoned orchards that they find using old maps, county fair records, newspaper clippings and nursery sales ledgers that can tell them which homesteader bought what apple tree and when the purchase happened. By matching names from those records with property maps, they can pinpoint where an orchard might have been - and they often find a few specimens still growing there. The pair carefully note the location of each tree using GPS and tag the tree with a plastic band before bagging the apples in zip-close bags and shipping them to the Oregon experts for identification. 'When I find an apple that´s lost, I want to know who homesteaded it, when they were there, who their children were, when they took their last drink of water,' Brandt said. 'We cannot afford to lose the name of even one of these landowners.' In the winter, they return to the trees - often on foot or on snowshoes in freezing temperatures and blinding snow - to take wood cuttings that can be grafted onto root stock to propagate new trees of the varieties that come back as 'lost' specimens. The task is huge. North America once had 17,000 named varieties of domesticated apples, but only about 4,500 are known to exist today. The Lost Apple Project believes settlers planted a few hundred varieties in their corner of the Pacific Northwest alone as they moved across the U. S. West to try their hands at the pioneer life. These newcomers planted orchards with enough variety to get them through the long winter, with apples that ripened from early spring until the first frosts. Many were brought with the settlers in buckets from their homes on the East Coast and in the Midwest. Then, as now, trees planted for eating apples were not raised from seeds; cuttings taken from existing trees were grafted onto a generic root stock and raised to maturity. These cloned trees remove the genetic variation that often makes 'wild' apples inedible. With the 10 latest varieties identified, Brandt and Benscoter have rediscovered a total of 23 varieties. The latest finds include the Sary Sinap, an ancient apple from Turkey; the Streaked Pippin, which may have originated as early as 1744 in New York; and the Butter Sweet of Pennsylvania, a variety that was first noted in a trial orchard in Illinois in 1901. Botanists from the Temperate Orchard Society identified them by comparing the collected apples to watercolor illustrations created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1800s and early 1900s and by poring over written descriptions in old botany textbooks and reference guides, some of them more than 150 years old. One apple, the Gold Ridge, was particularly hard to identify because the experts couldn't find any illustrations or descriptions of it anywhere. Finally, botanist Joanie Cooper went page by page through a reference book written by a botanist who died in 1912 until she found it. 'It's the luck of the draw,' said Shaun Shepherd, another Temperate Orchard Conservancy botanist. 'And we learn more as we go along.' With spring underway, the Lost Apple Project will soon enter its busy season as apple trees everywhere blossom and prepare to fruit. As they wait, Brandt and Benscoter are busy grafting wood cuttings from the newly discovered 'lost' apple trees onto root stocks and updating their records from the last season. 'It was just one heck of a season. It was almost unbelievable. If we had found one apple or two apples a year in the past, we thought were were doing good. But we were getting one after another after another,' said EJ Brandt. 'I don´t know how we're going to keep up with that.'

"A couple has recreated famous movie scenes using items such as toilet rolls and kitchen utensils in their home during the coronavirus lockdown. Fanni and Norbert from Hungary decided to pass the boredom at home by staging some of their favourite Hollywood blockbuster movies in hilarious low-budget productions. Using props such as toilet rolls, toasters, kitchen utensils and food items, the couple has managed to recreate famous scenes in some of the world's biggest films. In one photo, the couple is seen dressed up as the 'Men In Black' and staring at a tray of eggs in their fridge to recreate the scene when Agent J and Agent K found a group of aliens. In another picture, Norbert is holding up a pack of toilet rolls as a machine gun, with a TV screen of a fireplace playing in the background, to recreate a burning tank from the movie 'Commando'. Norbert and Fanni dressed us as Carl and Ellie from the movie Up and recreated the scene where Carl stares at Ellie lovingly with his head resting on a toaster as a post box. It takes the couple around two hours to stage threee photos, and they are now planning to recreate even more movie scenes. Fanni said: 'Norbi and I are performers and entertainers. We mostly work with events, so the pandemic has interfered with our plans a lot. 'For example, we are the leaders of an improvisational theatre. 'I am a huge movie buff and Norbi loves movies from the '70s and '80s, so our love for the craft is what inspired this series. 'When we were still at university, we loved dressing up whenever we had the chance so thanks to those days, we have had a lot of accessories and costumes.' Speaking about how they came up with the idea, Fanni said: 'Now we have a lot of time to do things we couldn't do before so we tried to make the best out of this situation while also using our creativity. We are happy to make people smile. That's all. 'My favourite one is Men in Black, and Norbi's is Commando of course. 'It varies for how long we take to do each photo. We don't have a formula for this. Three photos usually take us 2 hours. Yes, we have a lot of picture plans, and will keep doing it because we enjoy it.' "
"These incredible images capture the South Sudanese Mundari tribe which worships cows as equals and whose culture centres around cattle and cattle-herding. The photos were taken in the countryside of Terekeka,53 miles north of Juba, during the last two weeks of February. According to photographer Roberto Pazzi, 46, the tribe has a strong connection with animals, and each member has an estimated 10-12 cows. 'They are very very bonded with animals. Nothing is more important than the animals,' he said. 'They use their milk, urine, dung but never meat. They ""worship"" them but not as for example ancient Egyptian used to do.  'It is an interconnection with nature that probably could teach something to the first world too.' The tribe use dung to protect themselves and their cows from mosquitos. 'The children were collecting in the early morning the fresh dung in order to pile. Then it is mixed with dust so the dung becomes dry. 'After that they put in a pile all around the camp and light on fire. The smoke coming out is used to keep off mosquitos.'    "
"Experts believe they have discovered a remnant core of an exoplanet that is 40 times that of Earth, allowing them to see the heart of gas giants similar to Jupiter and Saturn. Dubbed TOI-849b, scientists believe its outer layers could have been scorched by the cosmic radiation of a neighboring star or it collided with another the planet. Other data suggests that there may not have been enough raw material for the exoplanet to completely form, which only allowed it to develop a core and not a complete atmosphere. Although TOI-849b's history still remains a mystery, it does give scientists the first glimpse inside of a gas giant. Scroll down for video TOI-849b was first discovered in 2018 by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), as reported on by Space.com. Data gathered from the Paranal Observatory in Chile and the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope reveals the exoplanet has a diameter about 3.45 times that of Earth, which is similar to Neptune's. All of the information combined shows that TOI-849b is the densest Neptune-size planet discovered to date. The alien world sits about 730 light-years from Earth in the ‘hot Neptunian desert’, which is a mysterious area in deep space filled with Neptune-size planets that closely orbit their stars. Sean Raymond, an astrophysicist at the Observatory of Bordeaux in France, who did not take part in this research, told Space.com that because there are not a lot of planets of this size, those that are there orbit a star very closely. Because TOI-849b is in close proximity of its star, the scientists involved with the discovery theorize its atmosphere may have been destroyed by cosmic radiation. However, they also say that such intense heat would not have been enough to strip the planet down to its core. The mysterious exoplanet is only about 6.7 billion years old and given the distance from its star, scientists say it would have only lost a few percent of its mass. It is also possible that TOI-849b collided with another giant planet while moving along its fast orbit - it completes a revolution every 18.4 hours. Another theory suggestsTOI-849b developed in orbit around its star and there was not enough raw material for it to fully form. However, TOI-849b may have an atmosphere of vaporized rocks and dust that is so thin, only the next generation of telescopes will be able to determine its chemical makeup. Distant stars and their orbiting planets often have conditions unlike anything we see in our atmosphere. To understand these new world's, and what they are made of, scientists need to be able to detect what their atmospheres consist of. They often do this by using a telescope similar to Nasa's Hubble Telescope. These enormous satellites scan the sky and lock on to exoplanets that Nasa think may be of interest. Here, the sensors on board perform different forms of analysis. One of the most important and useful is called absorption spectroscopy. This form of analysis measures the light that is coming out of a planet's atmosphere. Every gas absorbs a slightly different wavelength of light, and when this happens a black line appears on a complete spectrum. These lines correspond to a very specific molecule, which indicates it's presence on the planet. They are often calledFraunhofer lines after the German astronomer and physicist that first discovered them in 1814. By combining all the different wavelengths of lights, scientists can determine all the chemicals that make up the atmosphere of a planet. The key is that what is missing, provides the clues to find out what is present. It is vitally important that this is done by space telescopes, as the atmosphere of Earth would then interfere. Absorption from chemicals in our atmosphere would skew the sample, which is why it is important to study the light before it has had chance to reach Earth. This is often used to look for helium, sodium and even oxygen in alien atmospheres."
"Credentials belonging to more than 500,000 Zoom users were stolen and sold on the dark web for less than a penny each. The information was obtained through 'credential stuff', wheredata previously leaked in breaches are used to access different services. A cybersecurity firm noticed an influx of Zoom accounts for purchase in a hacker forum on April 1 and were able to obtain 530,000 for just $0.002 each – some were also being shared for free. The credentials included personal meeting URLs, email addresses and passwords, along with host keys that allow them to enter meetings and carry out 'Zoomboming' attacks. Scroll down for video The forum was discovered by the cybersecurity company Cyble and first reported on by BleepingComputer. A Zoom spokesperson told DailyMail.com: 'It is common for web services that serve consumers to be targeted by this type of activity, which typically involves bad actors testing large numbers of already compromised credentials from other platforms to see if users have reused them elsewhere.' This kind of attack generally does not affect our large enterprise customers that use their own single sign-on systems. 'We have already hired multiple intelligence firms to find these password dumps and the tools used to create them, as well as a firm that has shut down thousands of websites attempting to trick users into downloading malware or giving up their credentials. Although a majority of the accounts belonged to users, some of them were details owned by big-name companies such as Chase and CityBank, according to Cyble that has cross referenced the details to confirm they were valid. The accounts were obtained through a tactic termed 'credential stuffing', which is why the National Security Agency (NSA) has warned users not to use the same credentials for multiple accounts. 'If your username and password is compromised from Company A—who suffered a data breach—and you use that same username and password to login to your social media account, then that account could also be in jeopardy,' the NSA shared in a 2018 statement.  'We continue to investigate, are locking accounts we have found to be compromised, asking users to change their passwords to something more secure, and are looking at implementing additional technology solutions to bolster our efforts,' Zoom toldDailyMail.com. Zoom has become an essential service for millions of Americans who are self-isolating in order to limit the spread of the coronavirus. However, hackers are using this opportunity for their own agendas and are breaking into meetings. Internet trolls are 'Zoombombing' calls by displaying pornographic and racists content while users hold work conferences, online teaching sessions and even alcohol anonymous meetings – leaving many to wonder just how secure the service is. Over the past few weeks, companies, government organizations and schools have all banned the use of the video-chatting software. Google, the US Senate, NASA, SpaceX, Tesla, New York City SCHOOLS and the German Federal Foreign Office have all ditched the app for official business. Last week Zoom Zoom sent out an update with a new security menu to make accessing privacy tools easier. A dedicated security icon will feature at the bottom of the screen from which users can quickly access all the app's safety features. 'We recognize that various security settings in the Zoom client, while extremely useful, were also extremely scattered,' the company said of the update. 'The addition of this persistent Security icon helps augment some of the default Zoom security features in your profile settings and enables Zoom users to more quickly take action to prevent meeting disruption.' In addition to the new centralized security menu, Zoom said meeting IDs would no longer be displayed on the title toolbar. The company said this was to prevent others seeing active meeting IDs when 'Zoom screenshots are posted publicly', and using the information to crash meetings - a practice known as 'Zoombombing'. "
"Instead of standing out from the crowd, this new superyacht would do quite the opposite. 'Hide', measuring 164 feet in length, is a vessel designed to live up to its name and blend in with the environment around her. Anna Borla, the Milan-based brain behind the boat, said: 'I wanted to design a yacht that, thanks to big windows and dark colours, can reflect the landscape. Scroll down for video   'The use of the dark reflecting colours helps Hide to camouflage with the environment.' Her design, which 'has a focus on sustainability', includes a flat-roofed wheelhouse, which allows for the installation of solar panels, and there would be space for batteries for electric propulsion. Borla estimates the yacht - a concept at present - would operate at a cruising speed of around 14 knots, with a maximum speed of 18 knots. Inside the yacht, Borla imagines using 'eco-friendly materials and furniture made with recycled textiles'. Overall, the superyacht would be able to accommodate up to eight guests and eight crew members. The design includes an enormous owner's cabin with balconies, two VIP cabins and two guest cabins. Borla says she imagines the superyacht attracting buyers who 'love sailing and who have respect for the environment'. She adds that it is also an ideal vessel for those looking for 'privacy' as there are several 'comfortable spaces tucked away from prying eyes'. Other impressive features of the yacht include a spa, gym and open-air swimming pool with plenty of space to lay back and relax. Borlacame up with the concept for the yacht design contest Rossinavi Design Challenge 2020, though she didn't win. Despite this, her creation has stirred lots interest since and she says if a shipyard picked it up, it would likely take around two years to construct. Borla concludes: '[The yacht] is the perfect combination of luxury, relaxation and performance with an eye on sustainability.' The designer was recently named a finalist in Boat's 2020 Young Designer of the Year awards, thanks to her yacht concept Black Heron."
"Astronauts rely on highly-engineered and sophisticated pieces of equipment to survive in space, and none are more essential than the parts which form their suit. Now, the European Space Agency (ESA) has revealed a concept glove that makes the protective equipment smarter and more interactive for the wearer. It will feature a range-finding laser, a display screen to show the suit's status and gesture control technology allowing people to control machines, such as the martian drone or lunar rover, with a flick of the wrist. Scroll down for video The glove created by the European Space Agency has been made as part of a project from French company Comex and designer Agatha Medioni. It incorporates various futuristic textiles developed by ESA in a bid to create innovative space suit materials for the Moon. The glove is almost completely airtight and waterproof and is designed to withstand temperatures ranging from as low as -170°C to +120°C. It has been decked out with three high-tech capabilities, far removed from the gloves Neil Armstrong wore almost 51 yeas ago on Apollo 11. However, technology will be more crucial than ever before when humans return to the surface of other celestial bodies, whether the moon, Mars or another planet. The gloves will have the ability to control a robot, similar to a martian drone or lunar rover, with gestures alone. An integrated laser can measure distances and an in-built display on the back of the glove will show the status of vital supplies, such as oxygen levels. The latter is an improvement on an existing feature which shows this information on the astronaut's chest. However, this can only be viewed using a mirror on the astronaut's wrist. According to a statement sent out by the ESA: 'Bonus features of a future European spacesuit material might include self-repair, energy harvesting, integrated sensors, robot control and displays. 'The materials for the Pextex project will be tested with the partner organisations in France (Comex), Germany (DITF) and Austria (Austrian Space Forum, OeWF) and will run for two years.' On board the ISS there is a toilet which has several attachments. As there is no gravity in space, liquids do not flow but accumulate in floating globes. To counter this problem, there are hoses which are used and provide pressure to suck the fluid from the body. Each astronaut has their own personal attachment. When a toilet is not available or the astronaut is on a space-walk, the astronauts use MAGs (maximum absorbency garments) which are diapers that soak up all the waste. They are effective for short missions but have been known to leak occasionally.  Nasa is aiming to develop a suit which allows for long-term spacesuit usage and complete independent disposal of human waste. On the moon missions there was no toilet and the all-male crew had 'condom catheter's that attached to the penis and the fluid was fed to a bag that resided outside of the suit. According to an 1976 interview with astronaut Rusty Schweickart, the condom catheters came in three sizes: small, medium and large. Despite the practical advantages of having the right size, the astronauts often ordered the large ones and this resulted in a leakage of urine in the suit. To combat this, Nasa renamed the sizes as large, gigantic, and humongous to appease the male ego. There has yet to be an effective female equivalent developed, something Nasa aims to change for the Orion missions."
"Studying flying reptiles called pterosaurs that lived 200 million years ago could help engineers develop a new generation of 'super drones' with better stability. The prehistoric reptiles that soared above the dinosaurs are the biggest animals ever to take to the air and they ruled the skies for 160 million years. Despite their aeronautic excellence, these ancient flyers have largely been overlooked in the pursuit of flying technologies inspired by the natural world. A team from the University of Bristol discovered they could help much larger unmanned devices launch without help and remain stable in flight. Pterosaurs were experts flyers despite having a wingspans of up to 35ft - the equivalent of a small plane - and weighing more than 650lbs. First author Dr Liz Martin-Silverstone, of the University of Bristol, said there is a 'lot of really cool stuff in the fossil record' that goes unexplored by engineers. They 'generally don't look to palaeontology when thinking about inspiration for flight,' said Martin-Silverstone. 'If we're only looking at modern animals for inspiration, we're really missing a large degree of the morphology out there and ignoring a lot of options.' Larger birds use a run-up to gain momentum to lift-off - similar to commercial aeroplanes. Smaller birds and insects launching into the air through a leap or jump, also known as ballistic launch. Pterosaurs, on the other hand, may have developed a method to launch from a stationary position - despite some weighing about 660lbs. This was down to strong muscles in the wing membrane allowing them to generate a high-powered leap off of their elbows or wrists. Today, something like a drone requires a flat surface to launch and is quite restricted on how it actually gets into the air. The unique launch physiology of pterosaurs might be able to help solve some of these problems' . The largest pterosaurs had wingspans of up to 35ft which is the equivalent to a small plane and they weighed more than 650lbs. They should have been too big to fly, according to the Bristol team. Unlike birds with feathered wings, they had a membrane that stretched from the end of an elongated fourth finger to their legs, more like a bat. The flying reptiles also had internal structures called actinofibrils that provided extra strength and structural support while up in the air. Previously, engineers have largely focused on birds and insects when designing aeronautic technology like drones and planes. They might not think to examine fossils that - by their nature are often incomplete, said Dr Martin-Silverstone - adding that this is leaving large areas unexplored. There are a select few pterosaur remains that provide extraordinarily deep insight into the anatomy of their wings as well as their flight capabilities. 'There are two or three absolutely amazingly preserved pterosaur fossils that let you see the different layers within the wing membrane, giving us insight into its fibrous components,' saidDr Martin-Silverstone. 'Some fossils are preserved enough to show the wing attachments beneath the hip.' 'While you don't know exactly the shape of the wing, by knowing the membrane attachments you can model the effectiveness of different wing shapes and determine which would have performed best in natural conditions.' Analysing the morphology and predicted flight mechanics of these ancient creatures has revealed novel tactics that don't exist in modern flyers. Becoming airborne is one example. Launching into the air through a leap or jump, also known as ballistic launch, is standard throughout the animal kingdom. However, larger birds require a running start to gain enough momentum for lift-off. Pterosaurs, on the other hand, may have developed a method to launch from a stationary position - despite some weighing about 660lbs. Co-author Dr Mike Habib, of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, believes it was down to strong muscles in the wing membrane. These allowed pterosaurs to generate a high-powered leap off of their elbows and wrists - giving them enough height to become airborne. Dr Martin-Silverstone said: 'Today, something like a drone requires a flat surface to launch and is quite restricted on how it actually gets into the air. 'The unique launch physiology of pterosaurs might be able to help solve some of these problems' as found in launching modern drones and unmanned crafts. Pterosaurs also provide insights on how to prevent flight instability once airborne. Contrary to how sails can become unstable in a strong wind, pterosaurs evolved strategies to resist flutter of their broad wings. 'So far we've struggled to design things like flight suits that can resist the pressures of flight,'Dr Martin-Silverstone said. 'If we can understand how pterosaurs did it, for instance by understanding how their wing membrane was actually structured, then that's something we can use to answer modern engineering questions.' The unique physiological elements aren't limited to pterosaurs, either. Other ancient flyers, like Microraptor, had feathered wings on both their arms and legs. And newly discovered dinosaur, Yi qi, had wings that combine feathers with a bat-like membrane - a body plan that has never been repeated since its extinction. Writing in Trends in Ecology and Evolution, the researchers said many flight strategies of animals both living and dead remain to be properly explored. Combining our knowledge of them will give us a better chance of overcoming the hurdles still hindering man-made flight. Pterosaurs also had a highly specialised respiratory system, similar to that of birds, with air sacs in addition to their lungs. This is a much more effective breathing system, which is important for providing the large amounts of energy needed for flight. Pterosaurs had air sacs in their necks and trunk, and larger creatures also had them in their wings - they would invade their bones and hollow them out making the wing bones extremely thin-walled. Dr Martin-Silverstone said: 'We want biologists and engineers alike to reach out to palaeontologists when they are looking to solving flight problems, as there might be something extinct that could help. 'If we limit ourselves to looking at the modern animals, then we're missing out on a lot of diversity that might be useful.' The US is already testing interconnected, co-operative drones that are capable of working together to overwhelm adversaries. Low-cost, intelligent and inspired by nature, these new machines could revolutionise future conflicts - from swarming energy sensors to spreading out over large areas for search and rescue missions. The research has been published in the journalTrends in Ecology & Evolution. The pterosaur is a species of flying lizard that lived between the late triassic and late cretaceous period - about 228 to 66 million years ago. They the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved the power of flight and their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle and other tissue. The species were split into two major types: All Pterosaurs had coats of hair-like filaments called pycnofibres that covered their bodies and parts of their wings. They are often referred to as 'flying dinosaurs' but aren't actually dinosaurs as they don't share a common ancestor with dinosaur species. They were fish-eaters but also included hunters of land animals, fruit eaters and cannibals. They reproduced by laying eggs and ranged in size but were generally very large with even the smallest have a wingspan of more than 10 inches and the largest reaching up to 36 feet "
"This is the disturbing moment a group of hitmen mowed down a motorcyclist and hacked him to death in broad daylight while bystanders looked on. A Mexico City surveillance camera recorded the men's vehicle slowly pulling out of a parking space and trailing Emir Vázquez as he sped down a street in the Gustavo A. Madero borough on Sunday morning. Suddently the car accelerated and rear-ended the 30-year-old biker before crashing into a parked car. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT The gang, who was identified Mexican news outlet C4NoticiasasFernando, 59; Clemente C, 33; and Francisco Ángel C, 42, subsequently unleashed a barbaric attack on the defenseless man. Two of the three suspects took turns hitting Vázquez him with a machete and steel pipes while another kicked repeatedly kicked him in the head a dozen or so people watched up close. The suspects could be seen walking away from the scene as blood streamed from the Vázquez's face. An ambulance later arrived and transported Vázquez to Balbuena Hospital, where he was declared dead due to the injuries suffered in the assault. All three suspects, who were in possession of narcotics, were arrested hours later and remained in custody of the Mexico City police pending an investigation."
"A pride of 22 lions stopped a game ranger in his tracks when they surrounded his car in a South African game reserve. Pieter van Wyk filmed the lions as they spotted the large shadow cast by his jeep and made their way over to escape the glaring sun. Soon the 34-year-old found himself closely surrounded by the pride in the 15,000-hectare MalaMala Game Reserve in Mpumalanga. He was forced to sit it out and wait for the sun to move and the shadow to shrink, before the lions finally started to disappear and he could move on. One female lion pants in the shade of Pieter's car first before the rest of the pride begin skulking over. She looks directly at the ranger as he says: 'They passed by our vehicles and this ended up being their chosen spot, as you can see.' The lions line up one-by-one in the shade behind his car with each sticking their heads up to look over at him while he films. He jokes that this is 'South African problems', although it is unclear whether he means the hot sun or the 22 predators keeping him in his car. Pieter said: 'It was late morning and the mercury levels were rising as the sun climbed higher into the sky. 'The lions, Africa's apex predators, were on the hunt not for food, but for shade. 'They decided that the shadow cast by my vehicle would do just fine. 'It is not uncommon during hot days on MalaMala Game Reserve and it was their decision to come into my 'personal space'. 'Animals have right of way so I had to wait. But it wasn't too long before the shadow got too small and they moved on.' The moment was filmed as part of a series called Rangers in Isolation which sees rangers share videos of game drives and field work online during the lockdown. They hope people who wanted to visit MalaMala but were unable to due to the pandemic can still see the African bush and some incredible natural encounters. The reserve is home to the 'Big Five' animals - lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses and Cape buffalo - as well as cheetahs, hyenas, giraffes, hippos and wild dogs. It also housed Tjololo, a famous leopard who starred in the National Geographic documentary Stalking Leopards, until he died in October, 2007."
"Mike Tyson's friend and former trainer Jeff Fenech has revealed the ex-heavyweight world champion once locked him in a cage with his tiger. The boxing legendbecame synonymous with big cats after buying two tigers to live with him at his Las Vegasmansion during the heyday of his career - and was filmed wrestling with them on several occasions. Tyson, who has since expressed regret over the decision to keep tigers as pets, has been friends with Fenech since meeting him in 1988 and the pair worked together in 2005 in a bid to relaunch his boxing career, but a knockout defeat months later against Kevin McBride would prove to be the end. Former three-weight world champion Fenech, who is still close friends with Tyson, described him as 'one of the most loyal and generous guys in the world' despite revealing a terrifying tale of being shut in with his tigers by him. 'The first time I went to the house and he had the tiger,' Fenech told Fox Sports Australia. 'Mike had me and threw me in the cage and kind of locked me in there.I'm not scared of too many things, but I certainly had to change the undies when I got out of the cage.' Fenech also revealed how his daughter once got in trouble for recounting a story at school about playing with a baby cougar at the heavyweight boxer's house. 'He had a little baby cougar as well once,' Fenech added. 'Me, my eldest daughter Jessica, my youngest daughter Kayla, my wife Suzee, and my young son Beau, we were all over in Phoenix with Mike, and then we went back to Vegas to the house, and his little cougar was running and jumping all over the table. 'My youngest daughter was fascinated by it, got a couple of photos and stuff. My daughter then went to school [in Australia] – and she was young, like six or seven years old – and did a show and tell… and my daughter got up and said to the class that she went to Mike Tyson's house and she was playing with a baby cougar. 'All of a sudden my wife Suzee gets a phone call, and the school says, ""Mrs. Fenech, can we see you?"" And she says, ""What's the problem?"" '[They] say ""We've got your daughter here saying that she was at Mike Tyson's house in America playing with tigers, not a good thing to be telling these stories."" 'So my wife took the photos in and it went from a story to being the truth… the teacher thought she was telling stories, and that she shouldn't be telling lies in school.'"
"Former Real Housewives of Orange County star Kara Keough has revealed her son has died during childbirth. The 32-year-old announced the devastating news onInstagram Tuesday, revealing that the little boy, who she and husband Kyle Bosworth had named McCoy, didn't make it during a difficult labor. 'On April 6th, our son McCoy Casey Bosworth was born at 3:10am. Weighing in at 11 pounds and 4 ounces and spanning 21 inches, McCoy surprised us all with his size and strength (and overall perfection). 'During the course of his birth, he experienced shoulder dystocia and a compressed umbilical cord.' Shoulder dystocia is a birth injurythat happens when one or both of a baby's shoulders get stuck inside the mother's pelvis during labor. In the majority of cases the baby is born safely. Kara, 32, continued her post, 'He joined our Heavenly Father and will live forever in the hearts of his loving parents, his adoring sister, and those that received his life-saving gifts. 'I wrote this for the organ/tissue procurement team to read out in his honor: 'Tonight, we join together to honor this little savior’s gifts of life. Through him, may others find new hope and profound healing... and may he live again through them. May his legacy shine in the form of lifetimes aplenty - lives filled with laughter, compassion, energy, love, and most of all gratitude.May it be said that McCoy Casey Bosworth left this world in a better place, for a better place.... that he made an impact... that he was an answered prayer... that he was a hero.' Kara then wrote a bible passage from John 16:20 and ended her message with 'Until we see you again... We love you, McCoy.' Kara is the daughter of Jeana Keough who was a housewife on RHOC from season one to five and continued to make friend or guest appearances on the Bravo show up until season 12. Kara and Kyle are parents to daughter Decker Kate, four, and were excited to be adding to their family. Several weeks ago Kara was surprised by some friends including US soccer star Alex Morgan with a fun baby shower. Bravo host Andy Cohen and stars of the real housewives franchise shared messages of condolences after Kara Keough revealed Tuesday she has lost her baby boy. The daughter of Jeana Keough wrote in a heartbreaking Instagram post that her son McCoy died during childbirth on April 6. Cohen wrote underneath the 32-year-old's message: 'Sending love and prayers to your family'. Fellow Real Housewives of Orange County Stars Tamra Judge and Vicki Gunvalson also shared messages of sympathy. 'I'm so sorry, my heart hurts for you and your family. Prayers' Judge, who starred with Kara's mother in seasons three to five, wrote. Gunvalson, who also co-starred with Jeana, wrote: 'Bless you, Kyle, Decker and your family. I am so sorry honey'   Sharing photos to Instagram Kara said of the bash: 'Unbeknownst to me, my friends found a way to give me exactly what I wanted: a night with people I love, in my pajamas, without make up, with all my favorite things they make to eat, the Mother Load of Cheeseboards, and a 'BIRTH DAY CAKE.' I've never laughed so hard or felt so loved and heard,' In October 25, Kara revealed the happy news that she was expecting her second child, writing on herThe Pushover Project blog that she got pregnant during a family vacation to Europe. 'THE VERDICT IS IN: My new gut is not a rosé FUPA from France; it’s not a Swiss cheese fart from Switzerland, or a pasta clot from Italy,' she wrote. 'As it turns out, our little Eurotrip left our hearts, our bellies, AND my uterus quite full.' 'I intentionally waited for the right time to bring you into our family for a reason, I just had no idea my reason would be this freaking excited. It’s really damn cool,' 'We love you like crazy already, baby. April 2nd, 2020 can’t come soon enough.' Kara also wrote about Decker's excitement to have a sibling. 'She has your crib made up with a soft blanket and her favorite bunny 'Bun-Bun.' She's personally tested every single one of her old pacifiers to make sure they’ve met all quality control standards for your arrival,' she explained. 'She’s pushing the stroller around the house in preparation for her role as your best friend in the entire universe. She has graciously offered to change your diapers and give you baths and she’s very excited to find out if ""Jesus picked a baby brother or a baby sister for us,""."
"A woman has recreated her own McDonald’s Mocha Frappe - and posted a video to show how you can do it at home, too. While the popular fast food chain may have closed its doors amid the coronavirus pandemic, many have set to work in the kitchen in a bid to make their own versions. The savvy homeowner, from the UK, shared a video to the Facebook group Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK group, and penned: 'Thank you to whoever shared the McDs mocha frappe recipe. It tastes exactly the same! Maybe a little bit better.' The recipe, which was initially shared by The Chunky Chef, claims there are six key ingredients: Cold coffee, almond milk, chocolate syrup, granulated sugar, whipped cream and a chocolate bar for the finishing touches. The woman demonstrates how the first step consists of brewing the coffee and letting it cool to room temperature, before pouring the coffee into ice cube trays and placing in the freezer. After they have frozen, place them into a blender alongside the almond milk, sugar, and chocolate syrup. Next up, blend the mixture until the consistency is as thick or thin as you wish - depending on personal preference - and then finish it offer with a squirt of whipped cream, swirl of chocolate syrup and grated chocolate. The post, which has since received almost 400 likes, has been inundated with comments from fans of the chain. 'OMG that looks soo good,' praised while, one a second tagged a friend and commented: 'Why don't you try this, sounds amazing and I don't even like coffee haha.' Meanwhile, others took to the comment section to reveal they had been inspired to create the tasty treat themselves. 'Ohhh shall be trying this,' commented one, while a second added: 'I make these, as I don't have dairy anymore, and missed them like mad!' 'They were always my Achilles heal lol, but usually use ice cubes base from water! Never thought of freezing coffee! Totally going to try this way, worth a shot.'"
"A truck driver has been rescued from his cab after it was left dangling 70ft over a river when strong winds forced the vehicle through a bridge barrier. Ferocious gusts threw Wayne Boone's empty trailer across the I-64 Highrise Bridge over the Elizabeth River in Chesapeake, Virginia, on Monday morning. Boone faced choppy waters rushing below his windshield as the cab of the jackknifed Freightliner truck swayed over the river in 60 mile per hour winds. Chesapeake firefighters arrived on the scene and after they had secured the truck with ropes, Justin Beazley rappelled from the bridge to rescue Boone, hauling him up to safety in a harness around an hour and half after the crash. 'It all happened so quick. You train for this, but you just never expect it,' Beazley told WTKR. 'We all signed up for it. Anyone in my position would do the exact same thing.This one call of a lifetime just happened to be me this morning.' Boone praised Beazley's professionalism during the terrifying minutes, saying: 'He encouraged me to keep fighting you know, 'Come on you can do it.' 'It feels good to know there's still people out there who still care.' Boone was rushed to Sentara Hospital with non life-threatening injuries. His truck was pulled up onto the road by a crane a few hours later. Chesapeake Fire Capt. Steve Bradley told the Virginia Pilot: 'The tractor-trailer was first stabilized with the assistance of heavy equipment from Hudson's Servicecenter and Fink's Wrecker service to prevent additional movement and then a series of complex and advanced rope maneuvers were used to lower a technician over the bridge, harness the driver, and lift him to a safe position.' Alcohol was not involved in the crash, Boone had his seatbelt on and is not facing charges."
"From cross-stitching to backgammon, these millennials have picked up delightfully low-tech hobbies to pass the time during lockdown. Speaking to FEMAIL, 20 and 30-somethings across the UK told how they are seeking out activities that take them away from their screens and help them to unwind after a day spent in front of the laptop while working from home. Fashion PR Lauren Normyle, 29, from London, explained she had started drawing trees and birds in a bid to improve her knowledge of local wildlife, while Kirsten Millar, 23, from Edinburgh, has learned how to crochet after being inspired by her grandmother. Kathryn Dent, 24, of Hertfordshire is one of millions of Brits who have taken up jigsaws as a way to relax, with toy companies reporting huge spikes in the sale of puzzles in the three weeks since lockdown started and Amazon selling out online. CROCHET Kirsten Millar, 23, Edinburgh Kirsten, who is studying for a masters degree in Innovation and Technology Law at Edinburgh University, has made the most of her time in lockdown by learning how to crochet. Her favourite piece so far is a blanket made from 'granny squares'. She said: 'My Italian great granny was a really skilled crocheter. While we were doing the Great Lockdown Clear Out, I found a really intricate, beautiful piece that she made and some of my mums old crochet hooks. 'I’ve always been really creative but I’ve never had the time to properly focus on mastering a crafty hobby and, since I was going to be cooped up for an indefinite amount of time, this seemed like the perfect opportunity. Also I liked the idea of carrying on a bit of a family legacy. 'To make things like clothes or toys you need to follow a set pattern, which involves a lot of focus. It’s a great way of really switching off for a while and concentrating on something other than work or the news, and you get the added bonus of having created something intricate and unique. 'But, to make things like the ""granny squares"" that I used to make up the blanket, you follow a very simple repetitive pattern. They’re easy to make and you can do other things at the same time (in my case, binge watch the entirety of Sex and the City).' DRAWING Lauren Normyle, 29, London Fashion PR Lauren has challenged herself to sketch a new bird and tree each week in a bid to learn more about local wildlife while relaxing. She said: 'I had been consciously looking up and around instead of down at my phone during my daily walk and I was embarrassed to realise I couldn’t name many trees or birds that I saw. I made a pact to myself to learn more about them. It’s something that my grandparents would know so why shouldn’t I? 'I knew I wanted to learn more about nature and I was also keen to practise sketching for a dose of mindfulness. My aim is to draw a new bird and tree each week.' She added: 'Drawing provides time out for me, I’ve tried to meditate but it’s hard to think of nothing. When I sketch I concentrate on this 100% with no distractions.' CROSS-STITCHING Nicole Jordan, 24, Walsall, West Midlands Civil servant Nicole is working from home during lockdown and uses cross-stitching as a way to unwind after hours in front of the screen. She said: 'I've always wanted to have a hobby, and of the million I've started, cross stitching is the only one that's stuck and I'm kind of good at. 'I got a set for my birthday in February and it's just carried on from there.Lockdown has seen me amp up cross stitching, I'm doing it in a daily basis. 'One of the main reasons I enjoy it is because I can actually do it. It also really relaxes me - once I'm into a rhythm with it, I can mindlessly cross stitch for hours with music on it the background. 'Particularly being in lockdown, and sitting in front of my computer screen for eight hours a day without the usual mini breaks away from it you get in the office, it stops me spending 16 hours a day in front of either the computer or TV. It's definitely helped my mind focus more in the times were in.' She added: 'If anyone wants to get into it, I recommend checking out the geeky stitching co., they have some really cute designs perfect for beginners.' BACKGAMMON Julia Andersson, 30, London Julia, sales manager at womenswear brandChinti and Parker, is spending her free time playing backgammon. Her fiancé gave her a selection of board games for her 30th birthday in January and backgammon has become the 'clear favourite'. She said: 'Backgammon issomething to do other than watch TV and scroll through Instagram! It gets your brain thinking and keeps you busy. And, as a relatively competitive person (or very, my fiancé would say), it is perfect. You can just keep tallying up the results and it’s like an endless competition.' While the couple played backgammon before, she said spending more time at home has given her an opportunity to improve her sills. Julia added: 'Now more than ever, we all have time to learn new things and can put our phones down. There’s no one waiting for us at the pub and we’re not running late to meet friends. Spend time with each other whilst we have the opportunity and spend the time doing something interactive like playing backgammon.' JIGSAWS Charlotte Page, 28, Ware, Hertfordshire Project surveyor Charlotte, who is currently furloughed, used to enjoy doing puzzles in childhood but hadn't done one in a 'very long time'. Having more time at home during lockdown seemed like a 'good opportunity' to pick the hobby back up. She said: 'I like that it can easily be done at home and on my own. The only problem is I don't really have many puzzles myself as they’re all in my parents garage. 'I find it quite relaxing and satisfying when you see it coming together/being finished. This one was pretty tough as it has some very odd puzzle piece shapes! I found it in a charity shop the other week just before the lockdown. 'It was the only one left as it seems like everyone wants to do puzzles at the moment as they seem to be sold out everywhere.' Kathryn Dent, 24, Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire Kathryn, a banking assistant analyst who is working remotely from home, is one of millions of Brits who has taken up puzzles as a lockdown hobby. She recently completed a complicated Marvel design. She said: 'I started doing jigsaws because they are very time consuming but keep your brain stimulated. I've enjoyed the challenge as it's not my usual past time. It keeps my mind busy and completing puzzles gives me something to focus on achieving.' By Bridie Pearson-Jones for MailOnline It's long-been the preserve of an erstwhile generation, who might trawl through antique shops looking for penny blacks or unblemished limited editions. However, it seems stamp collecting has a whole new audience, amongst locked-down millennials seeking a pursuit that doesn't involve the internet - unless they showing off their finds on Instagram, of course. Hoping to get a break from their screens, young people are picking up philately - the study of stamps - from their grandparents for escapism, nostalgia and as chance to unplug from their busy lives. Suzanne Rae, chair of thePhilatelic Traders Society, told theObserverthatGeneration Y are picking up the hobby as it's tangible, relaxing and 'very Instagrammable'. Ms Rae, 37, who is only the society's second female chair in 91 years added, added that while many people are using it to unplug, they often share pictures of their pretty stamps online to spread the word and meet other young people with the hobby. The hashtag #philately has seen more than 310,000 posts on Instagram and Twitter and is also full of snaps of rare and historic stamps filtered to perfection. Speaking last year to All About Stamps magazine,Ms Rae revealed she gave up her job as a management consultant in the City to run a stamp business full-time. Ms Rae's online stamp shop, Art Stamped, is the first to sell using social media - and many of her customers are millennials. 'I collected stamps as a child, spending my spare pocket money at Robert Murray's Stamp Shop in Edinburgh. Like many, and encouraged by my parents, I would buy small bags of GB in the hope of filling some new spaces in my childhood stamp album. 'I loved learning about the world, and about myself as I discovered a hobby which I found competitive yet slow, never-ending yet manageable, adventurous yet calming. As a teenager with a growing number of duplicates, I started making little arts and crafts using old postage stamps, and later in life, I picked it all up again,' she revealed. Sadie Medhurst, a 31-year-old fan, added that the idea that stamp collecting is for an older generation is untrue. 'Stamp collecting is presumed to be a solitary endeavour reserved for the older members of society, but this could not be further from the truth. Each stamp tells a story: I often like to think of the many hands they have passed through,' she said. "
"Scientists working from home due to coronavirus lockdown measures were able to operate the NASA Curiosity rover - which is 125 million miles away on Mars. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory team continue to explore red planet despite not being able to go into their California office or use high end workstations. Working on ordinary laptops and using simple red/blue 3D glasses, the team successfully told Curiosity to drill into the Martian soil in an area called Edinburgh. The space agency said the team would normally be in a single room sharing screens, images and data but are now having to do that using online services and chatrooms. NASA started planning for its researchers to be able to work from home at the start of March and by March 20 the first fully remote mission was executed. The team began to anticipate the need to go fully remote a couple weeks before, leading them to rethink how they would operate. Headsets, monitors and other equipment were sent to the scientists homes - picked up from the curb rather than handed to the team members. Programming each sequence of actions for the rover may involve 20 people developing commands in one place while chatting with dozens of others elsewhere. 'People are talking in small groups and to each other from across the room,' said Alicia Allbaugh, who leads the team. So far it is a similar to many teams working in a normal office environment - but in this case they're working on something as remote as it gets - a vehicle on Mars. Since the lockdown and isolation measures to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus many people have had to find new ways of operation. Now the Curiosity team do the same job by holding several video conferences at once while also relying more on messaging apps. 'It takes extra effort to make sure everybody understands one another; on average, each day's planning takes one or two more hours than it normally would,' NASA said. 'That adds some limits to how many commands are sent each day. But for the most part, Curiosity is as scientifically productive as ever.' Working with teams on the International Space Station year round, as well as a history of communicating with astronauts going to the Moon, NASA is an old hand at remote working. To make sure everyone is being heard and understands one another, science operations team chief Carrie Bridge proactively talks to the scientists and engineers to close any communication gaps. Bridge asks her team things like 'Does anyone see issues with the current plan? Does the solution the engineers are converging around work for the scientists?' 'I probably monitor about 15 chat channels at all times,' she said. 'You're juggling more than you normally would.' She would normally go round several different groups working in 'situation rooms' where Curiosity's data and images are viewed. 'I still do my normal routine, but virtually,' said Bridge. 'It's classic, textbook NASA,' she said. 'We're presented with a problem and we figure out how to make things work. Mars isn't standing still for us; we're still exploring.' The technology barrier was one of the bigger problems to overcome - the team usually use advanced graphics cards in high-performance computers when working at the NASA JPL facility in Southern California. Planners rely on 3D images from Mars to calculate the path Curiosity to take and use special googles that rapidly shift between left and right eye views to show contours in the Martian landscape - but a home laptop can't run those googles. The NASA switched to simple red-blue 3D glasses - the kind given away with old 3D movie DVDs and while they're not as immersive they work, said NASA. The team ran through several tests and one full practice run before it was time to plan the ""Edinburgh"" drilling operation. The operation involved sending a series of commands to Curiosity telling the rover to drill a rock sample from a location on the Red Planet named Edinburgh. The sample was taken from sandstone on Mars - the first time it's been able to tackle a sandstone drilling site since they had to create a new drilling method in 2018. The Mars Curiosity rover was initially launched from Cape Canaveral, an American Air Force station in Florida on November 26, 2011. After embarking on a350 million mile (560 million km) journey, the £1.8 billion ($2.5 billion) research vehicle touched down only 1.5 miles (2.4 km) away from the earmarked landing spot. After a successful landing on August 6th, 2012, the rover has travelled about 11 miles (18 km). It was launched on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft and the rover constituted23 per cent of the mass of the total mission. With80 kg (180 lb) of scientific instruments on board, the rover weighs a total of 899 kg (1,982 lb) and is powered by a plutonium fuel source. The rover is 2.9 metres (9.5 ft) long by 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) wide by 2.2 metres (7.2 ft) in height. The rover was initially intended to be a two-year mission to gather information to help answer if the planet could support life, has liquid water, study the climate and the geology of Mars. Due to its success, the mission has been extended indefinitely and has now been active for over 2,000 days. The rover has several scientific instruments on board, including the mastcam which consists of two cameras and can take high-resolution images and videos in real colour. So far on the journey of the car-sized robot it has encountered an ancient streambed where liquid water used to flow, not long after it also discovered that billions of years ago, a nearby area known as Yellowknife Bay was part of a lake that could have supported microbial life."
"A Floridafather killed his two children before committing suicide and burning a bedroom in his home, say police. The Hernando County Sheriff's Department said in a Saturday press release that they were called to a residence on the 9400 block of Dunkirk Road in Spring Hill after getting a call from a woman who said she received suicidal texts from someone living inside the home. At the scene, deputies found 41-year-old Derick Albert Vasquez and his children - 10-year-old Kailani Vasquez and 13-year-old Kaedan Vasquez - dead and a bedroom ablaze. The woman, believed to be the children's mother, had been out of town when she had received the text. She rushed back to the home and and saw at least one dead person inside the home before calling authorities. Deputies and the Hernando County Fire Rescue found all three family members inside the home. The Medical Examiner's Office and the Fire Mashal's Office responded to the scene and assisted with the investigation. Records indicate that authorities were called to the scene on a previous occasion, on March 22, for a verbal disturbance. During a Friday press conference,Sheriff Al Nienhuis shared that there were 'some domestic violence type overtones' and that there were 'issues' but asserted that the department was still in the preliminary stages of its investigation. Nancy MacAlpine, the man's next door neighbor, told the Tampa Bay Times that she had come home to find the woman screaming outside of the home. She said that she could hear the woman yelling: 'He shot my kids.' Hernando School district shared in a tribute visual that the two children attendedJ.D. Floyd Elementary and Powell Middle School. A GoFundMe has been made for the mother of the children, who is currently unemployed in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. It has raised more than $13,000 after initially seeking $10,000.

"Spending months in space without gravity can cause the brain to swell and increase the risk of astronauts developing dementia, a new study revealed. Researchers from the University of Texas studied brain scans of astronauts a year after they returned from the International Space Station for signs of damage. The lack of gravity experienced by humans in space redirects blood away from arms and legs to the brain - causing a build up of pressure inside the skull. It was already known that extended spells in space causes vision problems in astronauts but this new study shows that the impact 'could be far worse'. Researchers are studying ways to counter the effects of microgravity - something that will be needed before humans make the nine month or more journey to Mars. The Texas researchers believe that the process of blood being redirected to the brain could cause its volume to balloon and the pituitary gland to shrink down. The pituitary gland is part of the body's endocrine system, releasing hormones into the blood and the damage could be irreparable. The team suspect this could cause difficulty walking, problems with bladder control and an increase risk of developing dementia if an astronaut spends too long outside Earth's gravity. One option being considered to counter the impact of microgravity on the human body is the creation of artificial gravity using a large centrifuge to spin people. They are also looking at using negative pressure on the lower limbs to counteract the shift of blood to the brain. Study lead author Dr Larry Kramer, from the University of Texas, said when you're in microgravity fluid no longer pools towards lower extremities. 'That movement of fluid toward your head may be one of the mechanisms causing changes we are observing in the eye and intracranial compartment,' he said. To find out more, Dr Kramer's team took MRI scans of 11 astronauts' brains, including 10 men and one woman. The scans were taken before and directly after their trips to the International Space Station, and then at several points during the following year. The results showed that long periods of exposure to weak gravity caused the volume of astronauts' brain and cerebrospinal fluids to expand. 'What we identified that no one has really identified before is that there is a significant increase of volume in the brain's white matter from preflight to postflight. 'White matter expansion in fact is responsible for the largest increase in combined brain and cerebrospinal fluid volumes postflight,' said Kramer. MRI also showed alterations to the pituitary gland, a pea-sized 'master gland' at the base of the skull that governs vital bodily functions from growth to temperature. Dr Kramer added: 'We found that the pituitary gland loses height and is smaller postflight than it was preflight. 'In addition, the dome of the pituitary gland is predominantly convex in astronauts without prior exposure to microgravity but showed evidence of flattening or concavity postflight. 'This type of deformation is consistent with exposure to elevated intracranial pressures,' said Kramer. The researchers also observed that cerebrospinal fluids flowed through the brain faster than before the space flight. They linked the result to hydrocephalus, a condition also affecting earth dwellers in which the ventricles in the brain are abnormally enlarged. So far hydrocephalus' symptoms, which include a decline in brain function, have not been observed in astronauts. The researchers are now studying ways to counter the impact of microgravity. One option they are probing is artificial gravity, which they could create using a large centrifuge that can spin people in either a sitting or prone position. They are also investigating applying negative pressure to the lower extremities to counteract the headward flow of fluid in space. Dr Kramer hopes the research could be applied to non-astronauts to better understand the way the body changes under different conditions. 'If we can better understand the mechanisms that cause ventricles to enlarge in astronauts and develop suitable countermeasures,' he said. 'Then maybe some of these discoveries could benefit patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and other related conditions.' The study was published in the journal Radiology. The International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (£80 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. It has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000. Research conducted aboard theISSoften requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen. ISS studies have investigatedhuman research,space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology. The US space agency, Nasa, spends about $3 billion (£2.4 billion) a year on the space station program, a level of funding that is endorsed by the Trump administration and Congress. A U.S. House of Representatives committee that oversees Nasa has begun looking at whether to extend the program beyond 2024. Alternatively the money could be used to speed up planned human space initiatives to the moon and Mars."
"A photographer has captured a rare glimpse into the everyday lives of London's Irish Traveller community, revealing how the close-knit group go about their day to day activities. The stunning images show young boys showing off their strength as they flex their muscles, while others at the Ealing Bashley Road site clean their caravans, showing how house proud the group is. Other striking photos show the moment a grieving woman mourns the loss of her family members at a highly decorative grave side. The true-to-life shots are the work of structural engineer and freelance photographer, Emma Williams. The Londoner released the photos in her debut photography book, We Call It Home – which aims to go some way to break the negative stereotype that surrounds the Irish traveller minority group. The 23-year-old spent four months getting to know the travellers of Bashley Road, visiting them almost every day, getting to know the community and earning their trust to be accepted into their world. Although Emma admits that some of the travellers she met were initially hesitant to be involved; she was even asked to dress down to her underwear to prove that she wasn't wearing a wire – something Emma says is understandable as the traveller community is so often subject to prejudice, exploitation and misrepresentation. 'It had always been a goal of mine to do a documentary project when I finished uni. I was particularly interested in capturing photos of something that's relatively hard to see or explore. 'In London, the travelling community immediately came to mind as one of the most unexplored communities due to their fairly closed nature. I was also interested in the fact that they are consistently shown in a negative light in mainstream media. 'It felt like they're a community that are regularly exploited and I was interested in showing them in a more honest way'. When she first went to the camp, she said there had been speculation about her intentions. 'Very early on into the project I had to strip in front of one of the women to show that I wasn't wearing a wire. I think after facing so many years of being exploited and poorly represented in the media there was definitely some hesitation about letting someone in. 'I think one of my main takeaways was that their way of life is so different from how it's typically portrayed on TV and in the news. TV shows focus on a tiny aspect of their life - exaggerating the way they dress and often focussing on negative aspects of their way of life. 'I was surprised that not once did I see the women or kids dressed up like they are on TV shows. I was surprised by how welcoming they all were. I expected to be turned away immediately but everyone was so open to listening about what my intentions were and when they realised I wasn't doing this for any reason but to offer an honest insight into their way of life, they were all really up for being involved'. She said her aim was for the photos to show people outside the Traveller community that they aren't a group to be afraid of. 'There are really strong family ties and this was a focus of the book, looking especially at the youth. 'I wanted the images to be an honest insight into a very misrepresented community. I didn't aim to play up any stereotypes but just took photos of what I saw. Boxing was a big part of the culture so this featured in the series. 'A lot of the time the travellers had input on what would be interesting to photograph. Angela, for instance, took me to her family gravestones as this was something that they were massively proud of. I didn't filter the photos to focus on any one aspect of the way of life but tried to give an overall perspective of life on the site.' The introduction of the book was actually penned by one on the women on the site, who revealed her deep upset about constantly being judged. 'Almost every traveller on the site spoke of their anger that the actions of a minority are used to brand their entire people. 'The photos, in my opinion, show travellers in a way that is very rarely seen - as people not so different from us.' The Bashley Road travellers' site was developed in 1985 and houses travellers of Irish heritage. For Emma, who first started taking photos of her friends when she was 15, a documentary photo series such as this is something she has always been interested in pursuing. 'I was interested in how traditions and culture have remained in the travelling community over generations. In the settled community, traditions such as religion have been eroded away significantly. It was interesting for me to learn about a community whose way of life is so different to my own,' she said. 'Before judging a group of people based on the actions of a minority, we should take a minute to learn about their way of life. Very little is made of the charity work they do, the pilgrimages they frequently go on, or the racism they face on a daily basis. 'The settled community seems determined to push travellers into extinction. These photos preserve the travelling community in a snapshot in time and I think now is such an important time to document them because their way of life is changing at a rate that it never has in history.' Emma took her stunning images on her Pentax 645 film camera. Finally, Emma spoke about how the current coronavirus pandemic could affect the traveller community. 'I think that coronavirus is definitely being taken seriously on the site. In a way, I think the travelling community is probably one of the less affected in terms of changing their way of life,' she said. 'The women don't leave the site much in the day and many of the older kids often aren't at school. On the other hand, if the virus was to reach one of the sites, it's likely that it would spread rapidly because of the sheer closeness of everyone living there. 'Two or three generations are within a stone's throw and this definitely poses a threat to the older members of the site.' We Call It Home by Emma Williams is available to buy from her website for £30."

"Saudi Arabia has doubled its use of the death penalty since King Salmanbin Abdulaziz came to the throne five years ago, according to human rights organisation Reprieve. 800 people have been executed in the kingdom since Salman ascended to the throne in January 23, 2015, following the death of King Abdullah. The most recent execution was that of Abdulmohsin Humood Abdullah al-Ghamdi, who was beheaded yesterday for murder, a report by Reprieve said. From 2009-14, there were 423 executions in Saudi Arabia. That figure has doubled in just over five years under King Salman. In 2019, Saudi Arabia executed 186 people, 37 of whom were killed in one mass execution on April 23. Six of them were men who were juveniles at the time of their alleged offenses. Two of those killed were teenagers Abdulkareem al-Hawaj and Mujtaba al-Sweikat, who were just 16 and 17 at the time of their arrests. Al-Hawaj was arrested for attending an anti-government protest when he was 16 and was convicted of being a 'terrorist'. Al-Sweikat was also arrested for attending an anti-government protest and was tortured into confessing to 'crimes against the state', according to human rights charities. The report claimed that al-Sweikat was held in pre-trial detention without charge for three years, and was subjected to torture by al-Mabahith officers including beatings, foot whipping, and cigarette burns. At least 58 of those killed in 2019 were foreign nationals that were accused of spreading Shia Islam - which is a crime in the Sunni arab state. Others were killed last year for participating in or inciting political demonstrations. According to Reprieve, which advocates against the death penalty across the globe, the rise in executions is partly due to the number of people accused of politically motivated crimes under King Salman. 13 juvenile defendants remain on death row in the Kingdom. Ali al-Nimr, Dawood al-Marhoon and Abdullah al-Zaher are at imminent risk of execution, according to Reprieve. Director of Reprieve, Maya Foa, said:'For all the rhetoric of reform and modernisation, Saudi Arabia is still a country where speaking out against the King can get you killed. 'In the run-up to the G20 summit in Riyadh in November, the Kingdom's western partners must demand an end to the execution of children and political opponents, otherwise they risk tacitly endorsing these flagrant violations of international law.'"
"An adventurous baby boy can't help but giggle every time he hears the shutter sound on his father's camera. Amateur photographer Jason Rouch Jr, from Palmer, Alaska, captured his son's sweet reaction to testing out his camera. The youngster sits in a grassy field surrounded by purple sprouting flowers with his father's Nikon camera continuously clicking a button to make the seemingly humorous noise. Completely disinterested by the mesmerising mountain ranges behind him, the little baby, dressed in camouflage dungarees and a checked shirt, hilariously laughs uncontrollably at the camera after every click. He looks at his father to see if he finds it just as funny as he does, leaning back, wiggling his toes and sweetly smiling. His father chuckles along with him and responds: 'Is that fun? You are just a natural photographer buddy. You're doing a good job.' Mr Rouch,a hobbyist photographer, usually takes the pictures but this time let his son have a go at getting some snaps. 'As Alaskans, we thoroughly enjoy getting out and adventuring. As a hobbyist photographer, I’m always trying to capture the best moments, but my son wanted his share of the adventure,' Mr Rouch toldViral Hog. Despite his father trying to get him involved, the little boy was much more interested in the shutter sound. The pictures he took may only be shots of the grass but the experience provided him with pure joy."
"The Swiss property where Mary Shelley wrote her famous novel Frankenstein has gone on sale for £2.38m. The writer and her future husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, stayed at the former guest house in the medieval village of Nernier in 1816 - and now the four-bedroom villa next to Lake Geneva is up for grabs. Mary and Percy had been touring the area with Mary's step-sister Claire Clairmont who was visiting her lover, the acclaimed Romantic poet Lord Byron. During a thunderstorm one night, Byron suggested the group have a competition to write the best horror story. Mary, who was 18, was inspired by the lightning storm to write the tale of Dr Frankenstein - who uses electricity to reanimate a dead body with disastrous consequences. Her story won Byron's competition and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in 1818. Despite being slammed by critics after publication, the book was a commercial success with readers and is considered a landmark text in the gothic literary genre. The house is spread over four floors and dates back to 1739.Stunning panoramic views of the Alps can be seen from the property's multitude of balconies, and the house is even adorned with a plaque commemorating Mary Shelley's stay. It sits perfectly positioned the harbour's edge, with a lower-balcony over the lake and a ladder leading straight down to the water.  On the ground floor there is an entrance hall with an open-plan kitchen, dining and living area and the balcony offers idyllic views across the harbour and lake. The first floor has an office area with a made-to-measure oak bookshelf and lounge with a fireplace and another balcony.The second floor has a landing with a built-in double closet and two bedrooms, one of which also has its own balcony. Yet more panoramic views are available from the two bedrooms on the third floor where there is second shower room as well as a large landing with a built-in sleeping and relaxing space. The house is complete with an internal elevator to make getting around much easier and the lucky new owner will get more than 7,800sq ft of garden. The new owners will be able to commute to the city of Geneva by road and by ferry to Nyon which is on the opposite side of the lake. Estate agent Andrea Thein Win, from Leggett Prestige, said the property had undergone a bespoke conversion to create the family home. She said: 'It really is the most perfect location. 'You have the sound of the water lapping and the breeze going through the rigging of the boats on the harbour. In the summer evenings you get the sunset over the Jura mountains opposite and in the winter they are covered with snow.' She added: 'It's around an hour's drive to get to the Portes du Soleil ski area so you can just take off for the day, if you want to. 'Many years ago, when the alcoholic drink absinthe was legal in Switzerland, but banned in France, this house became a hotspot for smuggling across the lake from the Swiss side to the French side. 'There are arches underneath the house, and under cover of darkness, this was the perfect docking point for the boats smuggling the contraband spirit into France.' She said the house had been a family home to a French-American couple who had decided to downsize after their older children left home. 'I think it would be the perfect family home for people with slightly older children. It's a year-round home - you can sail or go to the beach in the summer and drive off to ski during the winter,' she added."
"A British Airways jet crashed into an Emirates plane on a runway at Dubai airport on Monday night. The six-month-old Airbus A350 was reversing from the gate, about to take off on a return flight to London, when it smashed into the Emirates Boeing 777 that was parked behind it. Images from the collision show crumpled metal on the Boeing's horizontal elevator. The Sun reported that the images were posted to pilot forums, where aviation staff joked about the incident, using the hashtags 'Stay2metresapart' and 'Fly To Collide', mocking BA's Fly To Serve slogan. The plane, which had no passengers on board at the time of the accident, has a tail camera, but it faces the other way. The pilot would have been relying on ground staff to guide them along the runway. Both planes were briefly checked over by engineers. A BA source told the Sun: 'Technically the pilots are trained to keep looking back during push back.' Last night BA said an investigation had been launched and in a statement added: 'Safety is always our highest priority. The aircraft will be fully assessed before it is cleared to fly.' British Airways become the latest airline to send its aircrafts to a so-called 'airport graveyard' earlier this month, as the company tries to reduce its operations amid the coronavirus pandemic. The airline is set to move its Airbus A380 aircraft to France's Chateauroux Centre Marcel Dassault Airport in order to prevent its planes from rusting while they are inactive during the Covid-19 crisis. The move comes just a week after British Airways transported six of its twelve A380s to the French airport in order to be stored.    "

"The ancient creators of Stonehenge built the monument just like Lego, a rare photograph taken from above shows. A photographer is believed to have captured the key feature of the stones from a cherry picker and it was posted online by English Heritage.  It reveals how the stones were interlocked using protruding studs on one which fitted snugly into corresponding holes carved in another. This interlocking mechanism has drawn comparisons to the popular toy Lego but when builders erected Stonehenge 5,000 years ago it is believed this method helped stabilise the enormous stones and allow it to endure for millennia. The method – based on an interlocking woodworking method called mortise and tenon – was far more sophisticated than that used on other stone circles of the era. English Heritage, which looks after the Wiltshire monument, wrote in a tweet accompanying the remarkable image:'This is a rarely seen view of the top of one of the giant sarsen stones. 'The protruding tenons are clearing visible and the corresponding horizontal lintel stone would have had mortise holes for them to slot into. A bit like early Lego!' The charity's Susan Greaney said: 'One of the big questions is why Stonehenge was constructed with such precision engineering. It may well be simply that they wanted to make sure it lasted a very long time. 'Putting unworked sarsens as lintels on top of the uprights would have been pretty unstable. Our presumption is there were similar timber monuments at the time in which mortise and tenon joints were probably being used. 'They don't survive because they have rotted away. Stonehenge is the only one we have with this sort of working and shaping. It's exactly like Lego. We sometimes say to our schoolchildren who visit that Stonehenge is just like Lego.' Lego was delighted with the comparison, with the Danish toymaker responding to English Heritage on Twitter, saying: 'Ah, where it all began'. A Lego spokesman said: 'As a company that aims to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow, it was something of a surprise to see us linked to prehistoric builders; but we were humbled to be mentioned by English Heritage in their tweet comparing the monuments' stones with Lego bricks.' Stonehenge is one of the most prominent prehistoric monuments in Britain. The Stonehenge that can be seen today is the final stage that was completed about 3,500 years ago. According to the monument's website, Stonehenge was built in four stages: First stage: The first version of Stonehenge was a large earthwork or Henge, comprising a ditch, bank and the Aubrey holes, all probably built around 3100 BC. The Aubrey holes are round pits in the chalk, about one metre (3.3 feet) wide and deep, with steep sides and flat bottoms. They form a circle about 86.6 metres (284 feet) in diameter. Excavations revealed cremated human bones in some of the chalk filling, but the holes themselves were likely not made to be used as graves, but as part of a religious ceremony. After this first stage, Stonehenge was abandoned and left untouched for more than 1,000 years. Second stage: The second and most dramatic stage of Stonehenge started around 2150 years BC, when about 82 bluestones from the Preseli mountains in south-west Wales were transported to the site. It's thought that the stones, some of which weigh four tonnes each, were dragged on rollers and sledges to the waters at Milford Haven, where they were loaded onto rafts. They were carried on water along the south coast of Wales and up the rivers Avon and Frome, before being dragged overland again near Warminster and Wiltshire. The final stage of the journey was mainly by water, down the river Wylye to Salisbury, then the Salisbury Avon to west Amesbury. The journey spanned nearly 240 miles, and once at the site, the stones were set up in the centre to form an incomplete double circle. During the same period, the original entrance was widened and a pair of Heel Stones were erected. The nearer part of the Avenue, connecting Stonehenge with the River Avon, was built aligned with the midsummer sunrise. Third stage: The third stage of Stonehenge, which took place about 2000 years BC, saw the arrival of the sarsen stones (a type of sandstone), which were larger than the bluestones. They were likely brought from the Marlborough Downs (40 kilometres, or 25 miles, north of Stonehenge). The largest of the sarsen stones transported to Stonehenge weighs 50 tonnes, and transportation by water would not have been possible, so it's suspected that they were transported using sledges and ropes. Calculations have shown that it would have taken 500 men using leather ropes to pull one stone, with an extra 100 men needed to lay the rollers in front of the sledge. These stones were arranged in an outer circle with a continuous run of lintels - horizontal supports. Inside the circle, five trilithons - structures consisting of two upright stones and a third across the top as a lintel - were placed in a horseshoe arrangement, which can still be seen today. Final stage: The fourth and final stage took place just after 1500 years BC, when the smaller bluestones were rearranged in the horseshoe and circle that can be seen today. The original number of stones in the bluestone circle was probably around 60, but these have since been removed or broken up. Some remain as stumps below ground level. Source: Stonehenge.co.uk The stone seen in the image is part of the outermost circle of the monument, which features 30 sarsen stones which were topped with horizontal lintels. Original architecture and building methods have proved durable and effective as17 of Stonehenge's original upright stones are still standing. Five lintels also exist in their original position. Other monuments built at a similar time to Stonehenge were large blocks of stone raised upright with little assistance to ensure their longevity, but the craftspeople working at Stonehenge were more attentive. As well as the protrusions on the vertical stones nestling inside complimenting nooks in the horizontal lintels, the end of the lintels were tied together. This is another adapted woodworking technique, called a tongue and groove joint. Stonehenge was built thousands of years before machinery was invented. The heavy rocks weigh upwards of several tonnes each. Some of the stones are believed to have originated from a quarry in Wales, some 140 miles (225km)away from the Wiltshire monument. To do this would have required a high degree of ingenuity, and experts believe the ancient engineers used a pulley system over a shifting conveyor-belt of logs. Historians now think that the ring of stones was built in several different stages, with thefirst completed around 5,000 years ago by Neolithic Britons who used primitive tools, possibly made from deer antlers. Modern scientists now widely believe that Stonehenge was created by several different tribes over time. After the Neolithic Britons - likely natives of the British Isles - started the construction, it was continued centuries later by their descendants. Over time, the descendants developed a more communal way of life and better tools which helped in the erection of the stones. Bones, tools and other artefacts found on the site seem to support this hypothesis."
"Natalie Wood is the subject of a new HBO documentary overseen by her daughter Natasha Gregson-Wagner. The film, which will be released on May 5, is titled Natalie Wood: What Remains Behind and promises to be packed with not just several never-seen-before images and clips (like footage from the actress' second wedding to Robert Wagner) but also interviews from Wagner, Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. Wagner, who was married to Wood twice, spoke for the first time on camera about Natalie's death in 1981 at the age of 43. When Natasha asks him if the case of her drowning should be reopened, he says: 'I don't think there's a day that has ever gone by that I don't think about Natalie.' Wood and Wagner were married in 1957 and stayed together for four years before divorcing. They went on to each marry other people and have more children before eventually reconciling then marrying again in 1972. Natasha is heard saying in the movie that 'RJ was the love of her life.' Robert's nickname is RJ. There is a collection of personal photographs and home movies of Natalie, some of which Gregson Wagner discovered in her family's storage unit. Never-before seen footage of Wood's second wedding to Wagner was discovered. There is also a never-published article for Ladies Home Journal that Wood wrote in 1966. She addresses her thoughts on fame, affairs of the heart and family. 'The day my mom died, my entire world was shattered,' Wood's daughter Natasha says in the trailer. She was only 11 when her mother was found dead on the shores of Catalina Island in California in 1981. There have been conspiracy theories ever since about how she died, but the film does not dig into that as her daughter wanted to focus more on her mom's life rather than her death. 'Since then there's been so much focus on how she died that it's overshadowed who she was as a person,' added Natasha. This film weaves excerpts from Wood's filmography with archival material, including extensive family photos, diaries, never-before-seen home movies and audio recordings. Born to Russian immigrant parents in San Francisco, Wood was barely five years old when she appeared in her first films, Tomorrow Is Forever and Miracle On 34th Street. She went on to receive three Academy Award nominations for the movies Rebel Without A Cause, Splendor In The Grass and Love With The Proper Stranger. Her most popular film is 1961's West Side Story in which she played Maria; a remake is in the works. Robert Redford spoke about Natalie in the new docu as she was the one who got him his break in the 1965 movie Inside Daisy Clover. George Hamilton talked about how professional she was, Mia Farrow touched on her role as a mother. The movie, which had its World Premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, is directed by Laurent Bouzereau and produced by Gregson Wagner. Wood's sister, Lana, did not want to participate in the film, telling Bouzereau to let Natasha know, 'I completely understand she also wishes to keep her pain and her family's at a minimum.' Lana was involved , however, with the 12-part podcast Fatal Voyage: The Mysterious Death of Natalie Wood, which looked at Natalie's death. 'I am not making judgments,' she told the New York Times. 'I am not supposing. I'm not doing any of those things. I'm simply looking at facts. Natalie didn't swim. Her fear of dark water was deeply ingrained.'  "
"While kids of today log onto the internet and listen to their wireless headphones without a second thought, it's hard for adults to forget the frustrating technical struggles from their childhood. Taking a trip down memory lane, people from around the world havecompiled a list of photos documenting some of the most annoying technical experiences they remember growing up with. The nostalgic snaps, which have been collated online byBored Panda, include having to wait weeks to get photos from a disposable camera developed, and the effort taken to 'burn' a CD. Elsewhere, another recalled the length of time it would take to connect the internet on a phone, while a further reminisced over having to text soppy messages from a parent's phone."
"A herd of adult and baby wild elephants stopped traffic when they crossed a major highway in a Thailandprovince. The family of more than 50 elephants emerged from the jungle and stomped across the road in Chachoengsao, east of Bangkok. Spectacular footage shows dozens of locals gathering on either side of the road to watch the placid creatures. A large matriarch elephant leads the herd across the road as she leisurely strolls across to the jungle on the other side. She is closely followed by the rest of the herd all in touching distance with babies in tow. One elephant briefly stops before carrying on as the whole heard clear the road in just under 40 seconds. Several police officers also arrived to ensure the elephants made it safely to the neighbouring area of jungle. Wildlife rangers had been tracking the elephants through the wilderness during the day then quickly blocked off the road to prevent any accidents. The filmer, Pratya Chutipat Sakul, said: 'More than 50 wild elephants crossed the highway. They were moving together from one part of the jungle to the other. 'The wildlife officers had been following the elephants for the last few days. 'When they saw that their path was moving towards the road, they called the police and urgently closed the road. 'Policemen arrived to ensure that the elephants crossed smoothly and there were no accidents. 'Nobody minds waiting for the elephants, as the most important thing is that they're safe. 'The elephants were all so calm and barely noticed the humans. I feel very lucky to have seen such an amazing sight.' While majestic, the wild elephants in Chachoengsao have hit the news for the wrong reasons this year on occasion. Last Thursday, mango pickerChalermphol Sukthawee, 53, was found dead ata rubber plantation near a forested area at the base of Langka mountain. He is believed to have been stomped on by a herd of elephants in the district. A monk was also killed on February 11 when ignoring warnings about a herd in an oil plantation. Phra Prapop, 35, was in seclusion when he was reportedly dragged out of his tent by an unknown number of the wild animals."
